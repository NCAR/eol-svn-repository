This directory contain the EBUFR code, executables, and
supporting files for EBUFRing surface QCF files. There 
are 2 versions of the code: nh2e for data with 2 digit
years, and nh2e_4dyr for data with 4 digit years.

You can get the "best" versions of this and other code related to ebuffering in
/usr/local/RCS. This is the area where John Allison checks in any changes he 
makes to this code. The nh2e code is in /usr/local/RCS/fest_cvts/qcf2eb/hrly.
control_hrly.txt also lives here.

The code tables are pulled from the codiac database.  To get the latest, go
to /storm/encoder_tables and run build_encoder_files.sh.  Answer "y" to the 
three questions.

John and I added a new code for horizontal visibility - 20 251.  The old one 
was 20 001.  This new flag has a scale of 0, a reference of 0, and is 17 bites
long, so it holds values beyond the max 9999.99 that we can have in our QC
format.  It also now stores down to 1 meter (the old value rounded to 10
meters).  This was agreed with by Scot and Steve.
