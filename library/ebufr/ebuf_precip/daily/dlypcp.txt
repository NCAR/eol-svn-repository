               GIDS-1 Daily Precipitation Composite


1.0  General Description

     The Daily Precipitation Composite is one of two precipitation
datasets provided on the GEWEX Continental-scale International Project
(GCIP) Initial Dataset One (GIDS-1) CD-ROM. This precipitation
composite is composed of data from thousands of stations from several
sources (i.e., Daily totals computed from GIDS-1 Hourly Precipitation
Composite, United States Geological Survey (USGS) daily precipitation,
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) daily precipitation, and the Daily
precipitation extracted from the NCDC Cooperative data). Data from these
sources were merged and quality controlled to form this precipitation
composite. This composite contains data for the GIDS-1 time period (01
February 1992 through 30 April 92) and for the GIDS-1 area of interest,
only. The GIDS-1 area is approximately 85W to 106W longitude and 30N
to 45N latitude.

2.0  Detailed Data Description

     The Daily Precipitation Composite format contains six metadata
parameters followed by four data parameters. The metadata parameters
describe the station location and time at which the data were collected. The
four data parameters repeat once for each day in the monthly record. Every
record has 31 days reported, regardless of the actual number of days in the
month. For months with less than 31 days, the extra days are reported as
missing (i.e., '-999.99 7 M'). All records are identical in length. Each 24
hour precipitation value has an associated observation hour. The
observation hour is the beginning UTC hour for the 24 hour period for
which the precipitation value is valid. Data values are valid for the 24
hours preceding the observation hour given for the day.  All times are
reported in UTC. A Quality Flag and a Quality Control (QC) Code are
assigned to each data value during quality control processing. For a list of
possible Quality Flag and QC Code values see the Quality Control section
3.0. The table below details each parameter, including a C programming
language format description.

2.1  Sample Data

     The following is a sample record of the Daily Precipitation data.
Unlike this example, there are no carriage returns in the data. See section
2.0 for the exact format specifications.

2.2  Data Remarks

     The length of the station identifier in the USGS precipitation data
forces the composite station identifier field to be 15 characters . All other
composites and datasets allow only 10 character station identifiers.

     Negative precipitation and values too large to be represented in the
output format were changed to missing ('-999.99') and were assigned the
'C' QC code.

     The NCDC Summary of Day Co-operative data have observation
hours that vary by station.  Data values are valid for the 24 hours
preceding the observation hour given for the day. 

3.0  Quality Control Processing

     This precipitation composite was formed from several sub-datasets
(i.e., Daily totals computed from GIDS-1 Hourly Precipitation Composite,
USGS daily precipitation, TVA daily precipitation, and the Daily
precipitation extract from the NCDC Cooperative data).  Each of these
sub-datasets was uniquely and independently Quality Controlled. 

     Gross  limit checks were used to determine the quality of the data
in this composite.   Data values less than 101.6 millimeters (4 inches) were
flagged as good. Any data value greater than or equal to 101.6 millimeters
but less than 127 millimeters (5 inches) was flagged as questionable. Any
data value greater than or equal to 127 millimeters was flagged as unlikely.
Several questionable and unlikely data values were also manually
inspected.  After inspection, the quality control code and flag may have
been manually updated to better reflect the likelihood of the actual
occurrence of the precipitation value. Data was never modified, unless the
precipitation value was negative or too large to be represented in the
output format. In these cases the data value was flagged with a QC code
of 'C' and changed to a missing value (i.e., '-999.99'). A table of the
possible quality control flags and their meanings is listed below. 

After the sub-datasets were merged to form the GIDS-1 Daily Precipitation
Composite, a statistics program was executed to ensure that the quality of
the individual sub-datasets had been retained.

4.0  File Name Conventions and Data Location

     These data are stored as one file for each month, sorted by time
and then by station latitude and longitude within each file.  The files are
located in the /precip/dlycomp directory of the GIDS-1 CD-ROM and are
named `YYMM.pqc' where YYMM is the UTC year and UTC month that
the data are valid. The file for April 1992 would be named 9204.pqc.

in the /stn_list directory on the GIDS-1 CD_ROM.
