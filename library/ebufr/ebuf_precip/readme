This directory contain the EBUFR code, executables, and
supporting files for EBUFRing 15 minute and hourly precip
PQCF files. There are 2 versions of the code: p2e for data 
with 2 digit years, and p2e_4dyr for data with 4 digit years.

You can get the "best" versions of this and other code related to ebuffering in
/usr/local/RCS. This is the area where John Allison checks in any changes he 
makes to this code.  Old versions of p2e, p2e_4dyr, and the Makefile can also be
found there in /usr/local/RCS/precip_cvts/p2e.
