This is a python script that loads genpro-i tapelogs for the legacy data and
parses it so that it fit the yaml dataset format.

This script also utilizes the load_data_proj script in the 
/net/work/bin/scripts/insert/loaddata/ 
directory to display the dataset in yaml format. 

To run the script:

usage: movefiles [-h] proj arcid tapLog

  proj        Enter in the project name. Either lower or uppercase is
              accepted.
  
  arcid       Enter in the archive identifier of the dataset. This will most
              likely be the first time you'll have to decide the archive
              identifier for this dataset.
  
  tapLog      tape log name retreived from https://www.eol.ucar.edu/node/906

so for example:
./movefiles ssn 447.001 taplog.646.html

Here are the steps that the script goes through

1. retrieve taplog data from /net/www/raf/Catalog 

2. parses the taplog data to extract necessary information and saves it into a list. 

3. using the parsed data, the script moves the genpro files from its 
   /EOL/RAF/TL... location to the new directory, for example:
   /EOL/1979/ssn/aircraft/queenairb80_n306d/LRT/GENPRO-I/RF...

4. imports a precompiled template for genpro-i datasets.

5. creates a new yaml dataset for the project with all the neccessary information
   yaml datasets are then saved in the /net/work/cfg-files directory

6. load_data_proj GUI is loaded with the yaml.

7. the user has to check and make sure the data type, and manually input the long/lat

8. save the yaml file again by overwriting the existing file in the cfg-files directory

9. If loading the dataset, the user must not run load_a_dataset with the new yaml file
