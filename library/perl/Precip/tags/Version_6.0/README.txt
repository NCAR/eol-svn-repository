Previous to Version 6.0, the conversion module libraries and web interface were a part of a singular package called the conversion_modules.  They are located in the subversion repository at dmg/library/perl/conversion_modules.  Version 6.0 split the libraries and interface into seperate packages to allow individual upgrades to packages without being forced to upgrade the entire package.  This coincides with a change in the library deployment going to a single best version deployed and not a series of different version directories lying around.  This will require upgrades to any of these packages to be backward compatable.
