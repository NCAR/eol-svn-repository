      Pat is copying all media on my desk so that we can return to SCRIPPS.

       Need to continue archeological dig of 
          157 floppies/tapes/CDs, etc. from Scripps being reviewed.  
             DW needs accessible 4mm tape drive installed by MB. 
             Tape drive ordered?

                on tape, copied to mass store and available on Master List?
                TDF - yes, NETCDF - no.

                DW still asking GS/SFW about some other extraneous sat files
                from these same tapes. NetCDF not yet linked - still questions.

          Tanre - LEC sent Claude Devoux email for better readme and 
            same AOD data for KCO.

          SFW contacting Meywerk about ASD, BSI, MicroTops, and GPS data.
            Then will decide if this should be 4 different Radiation Meywerk 
                datasets.  from ZIP disks #34 and #35a.

          Blank Model (NOGAPS, AVN) images being removed? DS and DW.
