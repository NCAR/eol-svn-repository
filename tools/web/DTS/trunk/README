== Database Config ==

Unfortunately, database config is hardcoded in the source,
and in two places. It is now set to a dev database.
Deployment for production will require editing.
Verify that these settings are to a dev database!!!
(or whatever is appropriate)

November 2023 - JJA updated the mysql database to a newer version and then the DTS
did not work.  The error was "Could not create connection to database server." and
appeared in the left pane where the projects are listed.  JJA put a different version
of the mysql-connector library (mysql-connector-java-5.1.49-bin.jar) in the following 
directory: /net/web/dmg/webapps/dts/WEB-INF/lib.  This seems to have fixed the issue 
with connecting to the database.

== Local testing steps ==

You can run tomcat and dts on any Linux or Unix-ish box
(e.g. barolo, tikal, etc) as a regular user,
using a high port like 8080 (the default) or 6789 or
whatever port nobody else is using.

Get tomcat:
 wget http://apache.spinellicreations.com/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.90/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.90.zip
   (if this link goes away, go to http://tomcat.apache.org/ and download latest tomcat 7.0)

 unzip apache-tomcat-7.0.90.zip
 cd apache-tomcat-7.0.90
 more RUNNING.txt
  => aka http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/RUNNING.txt

not in the docs:
 chmod +x bin/startup.sh bin/shutdown.sh bin/catalina.sh

Then go to:
  http://localhost:8080/

The basic tomcat is there, with docs and a few standard apps, like:
  http://localhost:8080/examples/

Try that first. If you have trouble with finding Java, etc,
you may have to get Java 1.8 installed, and you may have to
set some environment variables. See RUNNING.txt for details.

Then, a quick test of DTS does not work, it turns out because
of one library and two VERY BAD database specs. What to do:

add latest mysql Connector/J 5.1 to tomcat's lib/ dir
  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
  https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html
  https://cdn.mysql.com//Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.zip

  cp ~jja/jars/mysql-connector-java-5.1.47-bin.jar lib

Also make a place for dts:
  mkdir webapps/dts

Double-check the database settings (see note at top of this file).

Now deploy the DTS app:
  cd /path/to/dts-src
  ant -Ddeploy.test=/path/to/apache-tomcat-7.0.90/webapps/dts deploy-test

Start tomcat if it's not already/still running:
  cd /path/to/apache-tomcat-7.0.90
  ./bin/startup.sh

Go to the app:
  http://localhost:8080/dts/
