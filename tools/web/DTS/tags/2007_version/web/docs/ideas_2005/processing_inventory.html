<h1>The Processing Inventory</h1>

<h3>Suggested Changes</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>Get rid of all of the Expand/Shrink Notes</b>
		<p class="joel">This does not work correctly anyway (at least in Firefox) as expanding the notes will write over the top of other data on the page.  It would probably also be better to be able to see all of the notes all of the time anyway.
	<li><p><b>Changes to the Project Page</b>
		<p class="joel">Only keep the product summary and the general notes on the page.  All of the listings for the products for the project will only be available on their own pages.  This will make viewing the notes easier along with making the page faster to load.
	<li><p><b>Close the Pop Windows when they are Done</b>
		<p class="joel">I find it very annoying that the window does not close when I have submitted the form.  It does not always go to the back after it is used, at least when I use it.
	<li><p><b>Adding Links to Other Projects to the Dataset Processing Page</b>
		<p class="joel">With the new database, we will have information about all of the processing of other projects for the same dataset.  We can create links to all of the other pages for the processing for other projects to provide a historical record and quick access to this information that may be vital to the processing for the current project.
</ul>
