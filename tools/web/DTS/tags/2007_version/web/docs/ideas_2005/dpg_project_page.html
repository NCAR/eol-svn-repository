<h1>The DPG Project Page</h1>
<p>With the new database setup, it will be possible to create a script that will automatically generate our DPG Project pages.  This could define the basic layout of the page, which would now be consistantly designed between the projects and would remind (force) us to enter certain things for every project.  Much of the currently displayed information would be read from <i>jedi</i> like the lat/lon box, the begin and end dates, and the project description.
<p>This would now require a script to edit and would be similar to editing the notes for IVEN.  This script and the part for IVEN that reads the project notes would now reference the same information in the database, thus reducing duplication of work.
