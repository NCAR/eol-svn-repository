Hi Sam,

We've finally been able to get through all
the DATSAV3 CD-ROMs you sent and we've found
a few more problems with our data order. We
plotted all the DATSAV3 stations for all the
times sent in our order and found large bands
of missing data across the US for the complete
time period. From a chart we have, it appears 
that the missing areas are stations whose 
WMO # begins with 724 and 726. This is only a guess. 
Please try to access this images at the following 
address to see the missing data bands:

Let me know if you can not access this image. We
will continue to investigate these bands of missing
data and we'll let you know if we uncover anything.

We'd also like to know if you have a very current
station list for the DATSAV3 data. If so, please
let me know where/how I can get a copy.

Below is a summary of the problems we have with
our current data order plus a copy of our original
data order. I included my early january request
for the SOD data since we have not received that
data yet either and don't know it's status.

Thanks,

Linda Cully

Summary the problems we have with our current
data order (Customer: 85366/Order Number: 69129):
-------------------------------------------------
 
1. NCDC COOP SOD - We requested the NCDC COOP SOD data for the
   whole US for "January" 1999 through March 2000, but the CDROM
   sent only contains data for "April" 1999 through March 2000.
   We are missing the first 3 months worth of data from
   January 1999 through March 1999.
 
 
2. NCDC DATSAV3 appears to be missing large bands of data
   across the US (possible WMO #'s including 724 and 726).

3. NCDC DATSAV3 - We received 20 CDROM's with HAS*, INVENTORY*, and
   PRINTFL* files.   CDROM's 9 and 10 appear to be missing some data.

   On CDROM's 9 and 10, we received HAS000006099[1-5,10-58].op. We did not
   receive HAS000006099[6-9,59-whatever].  We also did not receive
   PRINTFL6099.op or the INVENTORY* file for this data, so these data are
   completely missing.  Possibly CDROM 10 did not complete the creation
   process. In more detail, HAS0000060995 ends with
   "722523 KSSF 199801031647", and HAS00000609910 begins with
   "722536 KRND 199810260000", so we appear to be
   missing "722523 KSSF 199801031747 to 722536 KRND 199810252300".
   HAS00000609958.op ends with "722977 KSNA 199809090347", so we
   appear to be missing "722977 KSNA 199809090447" to whenever and
   wherever block 6099 ends.
