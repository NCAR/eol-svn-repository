The McD (Master List Combined Data Loading Notes) was a tool that was developed by
Dan Sullivan.  It was never finished and has since been abandoned.  It is put into
the repository for historical purposes.

The cgi-bin directory files were originally found in /web/cgi-bin/dpg/dev.  The
html directory files were originally fourn in /web/docs/mcd.
