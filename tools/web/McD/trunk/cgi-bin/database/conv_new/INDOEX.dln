         They updated their dataset(s) about 12 Nov 99 and told us
         to ensure we have the latest data in Feb 2000. Best data were
         gotten off of http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/aero/ for this dataset at
         ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/aerosol/kco/archive
         and JOSS requested that P.Sheridan/Ogren create a write up of
         what had changed in the data and email that to those who had
         previously ordered the data:

         As of late April, still not email sent, so we contacted Pat S. and it
     was decided that JOSS would prepare and send the emails to the 3 people

        verifying this. <font color=red>There are hundred's of tapes</font> and NG says

        on_line_phys_dir we need to say the data are at 
        /web/data/indoex/images/Model/ecmwf_reg_stream *not* the physical location.
        This /web/data location is actually a soft link to the 
        physical location and needs to be used to make the dataset
        browseable. This data does *not* need to be copied anywhere such
        as to /codiac.

        Make this dataset browseable by setting that on the dataset's 
        description page in Maint.
       
        Since this contains multiple files and I wanted to be careful to
        use the softlink given above, I have already created the
        insonline file that you can use to automate loading the file
        names/info into CODIAC. The insonline for this dataset is
        located on storm at /work/INDOEX/Model/ECMWF/Streamline.  See
        the create*.sh script used to create that. 

        In maint, create the dataset description (no readme available;
        online = y, order=y, browse=y), do the program/dataset maint page, 
        run the insonline script by excuting the last line of 
        /work/INDOEX/Model/ECMWF/Streamline/file_insert.sh in that directory.
        Remember that you need to be stormmnt to run that.
        Then set the Browse options of the Browse Programs and Browse Types 
        the same as done for 22.076. This is new. I've not shown you this before.
        When tested,  you should be able to browse the images.

          data tapes out there somewhere from when Chris Ceazan loaded the

          never loaded into CODIAC. In Oct 2001, RAF told us to link directly to
          their INDOEX project page at http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/INDOEX/ftp_log.html.
          At that time they did not have the data on their MASS store page at
          http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/. They told us that any project
          prior to CY 2000 would not be at MASS store but would have it's own web
          page like http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Projects/<project>/ftp_log.html. Since
          this data no longer used, it could be removed from the system? Also the
          associated CODIAC doc was /web/data/indoex/docs/C130_flight_params_1sec.txt.
