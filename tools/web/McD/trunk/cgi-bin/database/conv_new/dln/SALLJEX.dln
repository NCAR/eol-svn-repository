Data is interlaced in them. Cat the separate 1

supporting software is ATD "Solo" if people want
to "process or display" these files.

Note: Some files were incomplete, and catting them
with others made the others unusable. Told Jose,
and he said to put them out as 1-min files, then.

There is already a dataset 83.001 in the catalog.
That dataset was a test for this one.  Replace
that
dataset with this one.  Use the
SALLJEX P-3 mission table in the catalog to
determine the start and stop times of each flight:
http://www.joss.ucar.edu/salljex/catalog/missions.

Note that one of the files has a slightly
different
naming convention.  That is O.K.

The following main physical parametrizations
are used in the simulations
presented
in this work.
High-resolution planetary boundary layer
(Blackadar 1976),
Cumulus convection Kain- Fritsch (1993),
Explicit moisture scheme (simple ice) (Duhia
1989),
Cloud-radiation (Benjamin and Carlson
1986),
Bucket soil moisture scheme.

This characteristics correspond to both
experiments :
uba_mm5.exp1.03011700.dat
uba_mm5.exp2.03011700.dat

We skip precipitation fields because I believe
this are not reliable.
