===========
Double check, but these are new files I think.

Dear Steve,

please find the new set data from the DLR_H2O_DIAL
Mission on 09 June 2002
on the JOSS Server under .../IHOP/DLR_H2O_DIAL
named:

DLR_H2O_DIAL_DATA_20020609.zip
DLR_H2O_DIAL_IMAGERY_GIF_20020609.zip

In the Data and Imagery sets I also included
general Read_me files called
"dial_data_read_me.rtf" and
"dial_imagery_read_me.rtf".

Additionally, the Data set includes also
"READ_DIAL.pro" file, which is an
idl programm for reading data *.txt files.


There are also two txt-files called
"dial_data_contents_020609.txt" and
"dial_imagery_contents_020609.txt" which contain
tables of time intervals
corresponding to each Leg according to our
convention. For example:

20020609 12:42:00 - 20020609 13:03:59 =
ABS_020609_Leg1a.gif
20020609 13:04:00 - 20020609
13:19:59 = ABS_020609_Leg1b.gif
20020609 13:20:00 - 20020609 13:43:59 =
ABS_020609_Leg2.gif
20020609 13:50:00 - 20020609
14:22:59 = ABS_020609_Leg3.gif
20020609 14:23:00 - 20020609 15:06:19 =
ABS_020609_Leg4.gif
20020609 12:48:05 - 20020609
13:01:15 = H2O_020609_Leg1a.gif
20020609 13:14:30 - 20020609 13:19:59 =
H2O_020609_Leg1b.gif
20020609 13:50:05 - 20020609
14:13:25 = H2O_020609_Leg3a.gif
20020609 14:14:55 - 20020609 14:22:55 =
H2O_020609_Leg3b.gif
20020609 14:28:35 - 20020609
15:06:15 = H2O_020609_Leg4.gif

Please let me know, if I can send you also a
similar table for the data
sets from 20020524, which I already sent you.

Thank you very much for your help and efforts.

With best regards,

Gorazd


Old Notes:
==========
from email:

I put the images and ascii data from the Falcon
flight mission on 24 May 2002 to the
ftp.joss.ucar.edu server in the directory DLR H2O
DIAL. There are two data sets compressed in the
zip-format:

DLR_H2O_DIAL_IMAGERY_GIF_20020524.zip contains H2O
images and ABS images (Atmospheric Backscatter) in
GIF format for different flight legs.

The corresponding data in ascii format can be
found in H2O_...txt and ABS_...txt files which are
compressed into the DLR_H2O_DIAL_DATA_20020524.zip
file. 

NOTES: 

1) Ignore the DLR_H2O_DIAL_IMAGERY_20020524.zip
file. It has the images in postscript which we
don't want to use.

2) PI promises to send Readme in email.

3) They plan to update the archive with their
final data every time they finish with an
evaluation of one particular flight mission. So
more to follow.

Old Notes:
==========
Originally, this dataset contained images from the
IHOP_2002 field catalog.  The PI asked us to 
delete these preliminary images and replace it 
with new images, which were not placed in the 
catalog.

The original images were located here:
/web/docs/ihop/catalog/research/dlr_f20 - this
no longer exists, the images were moved to some
other directory within catalog (by Steve R)
  


from email:

I put the images and ascii data from the Falcon
flight mission on 24 May 2002 to the
ftp.joss.ucar.edu server in the directory DLR H2O
DIAL. There are two data sets compressed in the
zip-format:

DLR_H2O_DIAL_IMAGERY_GIF_20020524.zip contains H2O
images and ABS images (Atmospheric Backscatter) in
GIF format for different flight legs.

The corresponding data in ascii format can be
found in H2O_...txt and ABS_...txt files which are
compressed into the DLR_H2O_DIAL_DATA_20020524.zip
file.
