This dataset had to be removed from the list because it contained multiple storm_id numbers - ask Linda

         Note that this data was collected from the SAA (Satellite Archive) 
         by SL and for the EPIC Domain.  These data are in Terascan collected
         by our receiver. These data require Terascan s/w to read, etc.
         SL gathered this dataset and placed it on the MASS Store at
        /JOSS/DATA/RAW/BY_PROJECT/EPIC/POES/.  In that dir, the SSUX, MSUX,
        AMBX, AMAX, HIRX are the TOVS/ATOVS files. The LHRR and HRPT are 1km
        AVHRR files. GHRR is also AVHRR. Can just create interm web page
        to MASS Store area like others.
        Also might be able to get satellite readme files from DYCOMS - 
        check that out.
