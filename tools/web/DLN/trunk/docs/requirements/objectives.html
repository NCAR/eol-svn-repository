    <h1>DLN Objective</h1>
    <p>The Data Loading Notes is to provide a useful tool for the Data Management Group to maintain and manage the loading and checking of data sets.  It is to contain the location of the data to be loaded, the final archive location for the data archive system, the person assigned to loading the data set, and the person who is assigned to check the data set.</p>

    <h1>Problem Statements / Upgrades</h1>

    <h3>Version 2.0</h3>
    <p>Port the DLN stand-alone database into the merged DTS database.  Upgrade the DLN tool to use the DTS and ZEDI databases.  Add the ability to handle parts of the ingest task.  Change labels (as necessary) to be more intuitive to users and prevent confusion.  Remove functionality that is either not used or does not make sense in this context.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.1</h3>
    <p>Port the DLN tool from the old JOSS server (hurricane) to the DMG virtual server at EOL (tsunami).  The only difference is the physical location of the tool and its database (with some renaming of databases and tool locations on the new server).</p>
    <p>There have been other minor changes since to original version that have not been documented.  I believe some of them include renaming labels to be clearer, fixing bugs, etc.</p>

    <h3>Version 1.0</h3>
    <p>There is not any information available for the original problem statements for the intial version of the DLN.</p>
