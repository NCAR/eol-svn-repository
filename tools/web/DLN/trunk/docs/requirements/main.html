<h1>The Data Loading Notes (DLN)</h1>

<p>The Data Loading Notes (DLN) is a tool for maintaining the information needed to load and check a data set.  It maintains a set of notes, locations for the data, and which person was assigned to load and check the dataset.</p>

<p>The DLN was developed by Dan Sullivan (version 1.0).  It is currently under control by Joel Clawson and has up to version 1.1.</p>

<h1>Relation to the DTS</h1>

<p>The DLN is the piece of the Data Tracking System that handles the loading and approving tasks along with the ingest task to a lesser extent.  Versions 1.x are in the DTS architecture <a href="http://dmg.eol.ucar.edu/dts/docs/images/version.1.0.png">Version 1</a>.  The planned version 2.x are in the DTS architecture <a href="http://dmg.eol.ucar.edu/dts/docs/images/version.2.0.png">Version 2</a>.  The DLN fits into the DTS architecture <a href="http://dmg.eol.ucar.edu/dts/docs/images/version.3.0.png">Version 3</a> as part of the DTS web interface.  At this point the DLN stand-alone tool will be retired as it is no longer needed.</p>
