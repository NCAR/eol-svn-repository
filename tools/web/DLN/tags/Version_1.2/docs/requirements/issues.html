    <h1>DLN Issues</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p><b>Dataset Primary Key:</b></p>
	<p>The dataset primary key is NOT the storm_id, it is an auto_increment integer. John requested this be changed but there are datasets in the DLN that are not in CODIAC. The app could easily be updated so the primary key of the dataset table is the storm_id but then all datasets in the DLN would also have to be in CODIAC. The solution of course would be to add ALL datasets to CODIAC, even remote urls.</p>
	<p class="resolution">In the DTS database design to be used in DLN Version 2.x, every data set will have a unique dataset id (storm_id) and will be in the data archive system.  This will force every data set to be in the data archive system and allow all data sets for a project to appear in the DLN, even if no information was ever entered through the tool.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><b>Ingest Loc:</b></p>
	<p>The field for the ingest location is used two ways.  The first is for the location where the data was actually ingested (often /ftp/pub/incoming or /ingest).  The second is for the location of the data to be loaded into the data archive database.  These two cases are often not the same.  It would probably be best to have two fields, one for the actual ingest location and one for the data to be loaded.</p>
	<p class="resolution">In the DTS database design to be used in DLN Version 2.x, a field for the <b>data to be archived</b> is included.  This will allow a separation between ingest and data to be archived.  The DLN form will need to be adjusted to accomodate this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p><b>Directory Paths:</b></p>
	<p>Since the merger from JOSS into EOL, different machines have different paths to the same data directory (i.e. tsunami:/export/ftp == merlot:/net/ftp == tornado:/ftp).  This adds confusion (especially to people not familiar with all of the systems) to where the data actually is located.  We may need to have a field for each directory to tell which machine the path is for.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
