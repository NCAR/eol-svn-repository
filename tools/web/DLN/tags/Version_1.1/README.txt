The Data Loading Notes (DLN) is a tool that was developed by Dan Sullivan to
maintain and orgainize notes on loading data into the CODIAC database.  It has
since been used to include any notes on a dataset.  It has been taken over by
Joel Clawson and Don Stott.

The files in the docs directory are Dan's documentation for the tool before he
left.  The files in the dln directory are the JSP files needed to run the tool
on Tomcat.  It is the direct copy of the working directory less the binary files
that should be recreated before reinstalling it (i.e. the Java class files).
This directory should be laid out in a different way, but since a new upgrade that
will replace this tool is in the works, it is not worth the effort at this time.
