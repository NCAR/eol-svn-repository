<h1>DTS Objectives</h1>
<p>The Data Tracking System (DTS) is a set of tools used by the Data Management Group (DMG) to manage and maintain datasets throughout their lifecycle.  It maintains information from where and how the dataset came to the DMG, to who managed the dataset and did any necessary processing, to where the final dataset resides in the data archive.  It also contains the notes for the dataset.  This could include notes on why some task was done/not done, why something was done a certain way, problems that occured, etc.  It is to provide a reference for DMG to answer any questions that may later arise about a dataset.</p>
<p>The DTS currently consists of several tools in a revision of their first version.  It includes the Data Loading Notes (DLN) which maintains the information about loading and checking a dataset in the data archive (also any other notes that do not fit with another tool at this time), the Inventory tool (IVEN) which maintains the information on datasets that the DMG processes, the Master List (ML) editors and view that provide users a different way for accessing datasets in the archive, and QCODIAC which provides the DMG a different view into the data archive for checking loading information.  Version 1 of these tools each maintain their own database containing the information necessary for the tool to function.  (See the figure for <a href="../images/version.1.0.png">Version 1</a>.)</p>
<p>
<p>The objective of Version 2 is to begin consolidating the tools into an inclusive set of databases that work in conjunction with the data archive.  The new set of databases will allow the tools to use the same information instead of having the same information spread across individual, unrelated databases.  It will also provide a single point for a user to find the information for a dataset.  Version 2 will upgrade the current tools (while providing some new functionality) to use the new combined databases.  (See the figure for <a href="../images/version.2.0.png">Version 2</a>.)</p>

<h2>Note on Off-the-Shelf Project Management Systems</h2>
<p>The DTS is a highly specialized project management system as dataset that are maintained by it are always associated with some project (even if it is operational).  There are two major differences between the DTS and other project management products.  First, the DTS actively reads and manipulates both the DTS set of databases and the data archive database.  This allows the DMG to make changes in the system that will immediately change in the archvie as well.  Second, the OTS systems generally focus on people and time.  The management of time and people does not fit well within the DMG because the person aspect of the work is often dependant on an outside source (whomever controls the data) that the DMG cannot control.  This also affects the time since the DMG can only perform the tasks if the outside people provide the necessary assistance.</p>
