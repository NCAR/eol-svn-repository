QCODIAC is a web tool developed by Dan Sullivan and Phil Dressen to view information
in the CODIAC database through a web browser.  It has since been taken over by Joel
Clawson and Don Stott.

There are two versions, an EmpSQL version (1) and a MySQL version (2).  There have
been a few other minor changes between them, but that documentation was not created.

The files in the cgi-bin directory should be deployed in /web/cgi-bin/dpg/qcodiac.
The files in the html directory should be deployed in /work/DPG_HTML/TOOLS/qcodiac.
Development was previously done in /web/cgi-bin/dpg/dev/qcodiac, but does not have
to be done there.
