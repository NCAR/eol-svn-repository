The general Master List (ML) was a tool developed by Dan Sullivan to create the 
dataset archive list for the non-arctic projects.  It is the editor script that
is used for manipulating the database and generating the static HTML page that is
the list.

The cgi-bin directory contains the files for each specific project along with
common perl libraries.  It should be deployed in the /web/cgi-bin/master directory.
The html files are the common non-CGI files used by the ML.  They should be deployed
in the /web/docs/master_list directory.  The docs directory contains Dan's original
documenation on the tool that he created before he left.  The howto directory is the
howto documents that Dan created to explain how to create new master lists.
