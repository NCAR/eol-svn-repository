The arctic Master List (ML) is a tool developed by Dan Sullivan for maintain the metadata
for the Arctic dataset lists.  I think this has been taken over by Greg Stossmeister.

The cgi-bin directory contains the CGI scripts for the tool and should be deployed in the
/web/cgi-bin/dpg/arcti_ml directory.  The html directory is the static HTML, javascript,
stylesheets, etc for the tool and should be deployed in the /web/docs/dpg/arctic_ml
directory.  The docs directory contains the files that Dan created for the tool before he
left.
