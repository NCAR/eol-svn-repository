        <p>Provides a set of states used by the General Master List.</p>
        <p>All of the states defined in this package are <i>Concrete States</i>
        for the <b>State</b> pattern defined in the <u>Design Patterns</u> by 
        Gamma, et. al.</p>
        <p>There are two sets of states.  They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Category States: that manipulate Categories in the database.
            </li>
            <li>Dataset States: that manipulate Datasets in the database.</li>
            <li>Project States: that manipulate Projects in the database.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete States: that delete entries from the database.</li>
            <li>Edit States: that edits entries from the database.</li>
            <li>List States: that list entries in the database.</li>
        </ul>
