<h1>The General Master List Editor</h1>
<p>The General Master List (ML) is a tool for organizing data sets for a project in a way that is not available in the current data ordering system and is more useful to the end users.  It groups the data sets by their categories for quicker access within the project.</p>

<p>The General ML was developed by Dan Sullivan (version 1.0 and 1.1).  It is currently being controled by Joel Clawson and is up to version 1.2.</p>

<h1>Relation to the DTS</h1>
<p>The General ML is a small piece of the Data Tracking System.  It handles assigning data sets to project's ML and providing other information that is useful to the user that is not typically part of a data set (if it is new, if the data has been updated, date the data set was made available, etc.).</p>
<p>Versions 1.x and 2.x are in the DTS architecture <a href="http://dmg.eol.ucar.edu/dts/docs/images/version.1.0.png">Version 1.0</a>.  All planned upgrades after Versions 2.x are merged with the Arctic Master List editor into a single merged Master List.  All documentation for the merged Master List can be found ???.</p>
