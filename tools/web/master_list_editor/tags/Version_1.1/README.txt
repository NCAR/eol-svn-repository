The Master List is a collection of 3 different Master List tools.  The general directory
contains the files for the basic meteorological project master lists (i.e. BAMEX, NAME, 
...).  The arctic directory contains the master list files for the arctic projects (i.e.
ATLAS, SBI, ...).  The improved directory contains the abandoned upgrade tool for the
general master list.
