<br>
<b>Directory: </b><a href=howto>howto</a><br>
<b>Actual Location: </b>/web/docs/dpg/master_list/howto
<p>
This directory contains an explaination of how to create a new master list for a new project, and the
needed files.

<a name=cgi><font size=+1><b><u>CGI Scripts</u></b></font></a><br>
<br>
<b>Actual Location: </b>/web/cgi-bin/master
<p>
This directory contains a sub-directory for each project using the master list.  Within each project 
directory is a copy of the master_list script which allows users to edit the project's master list.
The script is essentially the same for each project with a few changes to constant variables at the 
top.

<a name=database><font size=+1><b><u>Database</u></b></font></a><br>
<p>
The <i>How To</i> above explains how to add projects to the database.  Each project has it's
own set of tables (i.e. when a new project is added a new set of tables have to be created).  
These files explain only one set of these tables.
</p>
To access the database:
	<dd>mysql -h hurricane -u stormdba -p ml
	<dd>See John or Don for the password <br>

<b>'New!' Icon:</b><br>
In May, 2004 a 'new' icon feature was implemented such that if a dataset was added to the system
within the last 90 days a 'New!' icon is placed above the date.  Since the public side of the ML
system is not dynamic - the public views a static html file as opposed to some CGI script which
queries the database - these 'New!' icons can become out-of-date if the master list is not
updated for a long period of time.  Each time a project's master list is updated the script writes a new static
html file for the public.  When this file is written it checks each dataset to see if it requires
a 'New!' icon.  So only one dataset has to be updated to remove any out-of-date 'New!' icons.
</p>

<p>
<b>Does not support multiple projects</b><br>
This system was originally written for IHOP_2002 and not for use by multiple projects.  Therefore
each time a new project is added a new set of tables has to be created and a new version of the
script has to be set up.  The Improved Master List was developed to get rid of all the down-falls 
of this system but was never put into use.
