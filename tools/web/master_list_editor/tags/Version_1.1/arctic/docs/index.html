<br>
<b>Directory: </b><a href=cgi>cgi</a><br>
<b>Actual Location: </b>/web/cgi-bin/dpg/arctic_ml<br>
<p>
This directory contains the CGI code, written in Perl, to display the editor and to
query the database for view by the public.
</p>
<p>
<b>Editor: </b><br>
	<dd><b>master_maint</b> - displays all aspects of the editor.
	<dd><b>lib/</b> - contains various modules used by both editor and query scripts.  
	<dd><b>mysql_codiac/</b> - contains new scripts for when CODIAC goes to MySQL see <a href=#other>other</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>Query: </b><br>
The master_query script was set up to give Greg flexability in how the project master 
lists are displayed. The script takes several arguments including what parameters to
display, what to sort by, what title to give the list, etc.  The usage of this script is
outlined in the <a href=html/query_howto.html>Query How To</a>.
	<dd><b>master_query</b> - queries the database and displays the master list
	<dd><b>ml_summary</b> - simple script to display a summary of all the datasets in a 
    particular project. usage: ml_summary?project=ATLAS  
	<dd><b>codiac_readme</b> - if no 'Documentation' link is entered into the master list,
    the master_query script displays a link to the codiac_readme script which redirects the user to the
    dataset's readme file in CODIAC. usage: codiac_readme?storm_id=46.001 
	<dd><b>lib/</b> - contains various modules used by master_query

<b>Directory: </b><a href=html>html</a><br>
<b>Actual Location: </b>/web/docs/dpg/arctic_ml
<p>
This directory contains the needed html files to display the master list Editor and the Query How To
page.
</p>
<p>
	<dd><b>index.html</b> - Displays the needed frameset.  Renamed to index_.html for this documentation.
	<dd><b>introFrame.html </b> - Simple welcome message.
	<dd><b>master.js </b> - various javascript functions used by the editor
	<dd><b>overview.html </b> - this was put together before the application was written, probably not
    of much interest.
	<dd><b>query_howto.html </b> - documentation on how to use the master_query script.

<a name=database><font size=+1><b><u>Database</u></b></font></a><br>
<p>
The Arctic Master List uses the <b>master_list</b> database located on thunder.  The CGI scripts use the
suldan username/password to access the database (talk to Greg or Mark to get the suldan password).  Other
users <i>may</i> be able to access the database (I think Don has the permissions) but talk to Mark about
those kinds of details.  The version of MySQL on thunder is rather old and lacks Foreign Key Constraints,
which are used by the database.   These constraints are maintained by the application, so should not be 
a problem, but watch out when adding new records manually.
</p>

To access the database:
	<dd>mysql -h thunder -u suldan -p master_list<br>

<b>CODIAC to MySQL</b>
The directory <code>/web/cgi-bin/dpg/arctic_ml/mysql_codiac</code> contains new scripts which can be used
when CODIAC moves over to MySQL.  Currently it queries the injedi3 database on gale.  The name and host
of the database will probably change so the scripts will have to be updated slightly.  See the scripts
themselves to see how to change the database and host names.  The only
scripts which are affected is the master_query script and codiac_readme script.  Just copies those
over to the <code>/web/cgi-bin/dpg/arctic_ml</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): </b><br>
The master_query script uses a simple cascading sheet to display the master lists.
Each project has its own style sheet to match Greg's main project page.  
The css files are located here: /web/docs/atlas/css.  ALL css files are located in
this directory, including SBI and SHEBA.  At one point they were located somewhere
under /web/docs/dpg which caused the dpg username/password to pop up.  Placing them
in the atlas area was the quick fix, they should probably be moved to a more logical
place.  The file names follow the convention - PROJECT.css - where project is the 
project name entered into the master list database.
