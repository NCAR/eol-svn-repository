<h3>Objective:</h3>
<p>Develop a web-based tool that maintains a MySQL database of dataset information. This database can then be 
queried to display master lists by different fields such as PI and discipline.  The project
has two stages or parts: <br><dd>1) Develop an html form-based tool that allows users to add, delete, and update
dataset information.  <br><dd>2) Develop a script that queries the database and dynamically builds master tables. 
Currently no GUI is planned. The database will simply be queried through hard coded links.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Fields:</h3>
<p>The following fields will be included in the database and will be the fields by which the master tables
can be built.</p>

<dd><b>1) storm_id:</b> The storm_id of the dataset in Codiac, if available.
<dd><b>2) title:</b> The title of the dataset to be displayed in the table.
<dd><b>3) author/PI:</b> Dataset's author or PI. 
<dd><b>4) platform:</b> Dataset's platform. 
<dd><b>5) data type:</b> The type of data this dataset consists of. 
<dd><b>6) discipline:</b> Dataset's discipline. 
<dd><b>7) date:</b> General date, can be determined later whether this is the date entered into Master List
                    database or date submitted by PI.
<dd><b>8) project:</b> The project this dataset belongs. 
<dd><b>9) documentation url:</b> URL that links the dataset to its documentation.

<h3>Scripts</h3>

<h4>Part One: Master List Maintenance</h4>
<p>A script called master_maint will allow users, via the web, to add, delete and update datasets
for the master list.  This will be similar to the Data Loading Notes pages developed before.  
<a href=master_maint_tst.html>Form example.</a></p>

<h4>Part Two: Master List Query</h4>
<p>A script called master_query will allow hard coded links to query the database and then display
tables based on the query.  It is possible for this to turn into a form-based query but is not in the
current plan.</p> 

<hr>
<h3>Link To Data Loading Notes Page:</h3>
<p>The most logical approach to this project is to link it to the already existing 
<a href=http://www.joss.ucar.edu/dpg/notes>data loading notes</a> pages that are also backed with a MySQL database.
The data loading notes contains similar fields such as storm_id and title and it makes little sense to be 
entering in a single dataset's information at least three times (data loading notes, master list, and then Codiac).
We should be able to combine at least two of these steps.  This will also help keep naming consistent.  I have
often come across datasets in master tables that have completely different names than what is in the data 
loading notes and Codiac.  This makes it difficult to keep track of what is what when you have little knowledge
of the data and/or the project.  There are two ways in which these two steps could be combined:</p>
<dd>1) Develop one application and one database that combine this master list application with the already 
developed data loading notes.  In terms of future projects and use this is the best way to go, but this 
would involve some serious time, which is not available, and is getting 
too close to Codiac.  Also, others may not be interested in the master list setup but will still want to 
use the data loading notes.  This is getting a little touchy and I'm not sure it is the direction I want to 
take.<br>
<dd>2) Link the master list application to the data loading notes application.  In this manner when a dataset is added
to the master list database (using master_maint) the dataset information would also be added to the data 
loading notes database.  Fields such as title and storm_id that are similar to the two projects could be
added to both databases in one shot.  The user would then have to turn around and update the notes, person loading, 
archive location, etc. in  the data loading notes.  This would keep the data loading notes independent 
so the master list application would not have to be used by all the projects that use the data loading notes.  
This method would also prevent entering in the same data twice and help keep naming conventions consistent.
<br>
<p>
Because of time constraints the master list application will be developed without linking it to the data loading
notes.  But I think linking the two should at least be tested to see if it makes things more efficient and
less confusing.
