This directory contains the modules used by the master_maint and master_query scripts.
The Row.pm and Table.pm modules were developed for the original data loading notes page
but were generic enough to be used by this application - so don't be confused if the
comments within them refer to the 'data notes'.

The EQuery.pm module is a nice tool which allows the user to query the CODIAC Empress database
using the empcmd utility.  This module is also used in the QCODIAC tool, the latest version
can be found here: /web/docs/dpg/BEST_SW/GENERAL_TOOLS/EQuery
