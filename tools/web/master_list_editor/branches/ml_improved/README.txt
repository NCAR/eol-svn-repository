The Improved Master List (ML) is a tool that was being created by Dan Sullivan.  It
was intended to be an upgrade to the general ML, but was abandoned.

The cgi-bin directory contains the CGI scripts for the tool and were in
/web/cgi-bin/dpg/ml.  The dev directory contains the scripts that were in the
/web/cgi-bin/dpg/dev/ml development area and may be the same as the cgi-bin
directory.  The html directory is the static pages that were originally in
/web/docs/master_list.  This may contain other files that are the same as the
general ML, but since this is abandoned, I just copied the entire directory to
make sure that it had everything that was needed.
