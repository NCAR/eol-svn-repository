<h1>DTS Version 2.0</h1>
<p>The Data Tracking System Version 2.0 is a set of new databases that combine and expand on the <a href="../images/version.1.0.png">Version 1.0</a> databases.  The new databases utililze the information in the data archive system to prevent to duplication of information as well.  It upgrades and expandes the current tools to handle the changes.</p>
<p>The Master Lists are different than the other tools.  They require more work than the other tools before they are ready to be merged into the Version 2.0 system.  For this reason, the Master Lists will go be merged in three phases.<ol>
   <li>Upgrading the existing stand alone databases and associated tools to work in a cleaner fashion (both general and arctic)</li>
   <li>Merge the general and arctic databases into a single stand alone master list database and merge the editors into a single tool</li>
   <li>Merge the stand alone master list database into the new master list database that fits within the new DTS/data archive system structure</li>
</ol></p>
