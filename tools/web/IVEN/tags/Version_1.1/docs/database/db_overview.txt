Database Overview
-----------------
Dan Sullivan

Below is a quick overview of the iven database.  More detailed information can be found in the
dbinfo.txt file.

* indicates the primary keys

users
-----
	{uid*, fname, lname, email, active}
The uid is a unique identifier used for JOSS staff members throughout the office and in 
other applications.  The active flag signifies whether or not the user is still active within 
the office.

projects
--------
	{ pjname*, full_name, storm_id_prefix, begin_date, end_date, minlat, maxlat, minlon, 
	   maxlon, admin_notes, link_source, link_target, charge_num }
The pjname is a unique identifier used in other JOSS applications.  Most of the attributes 
are simply displayed at the top of Iven for reference.  The link_source and link_target are 
the components of a symbolic link established so the data links in the dataset table can be 
seen on the web.

products
--------
	{ pdname*, pjname*, status }
The pjname attribute is a foreign key of the projects table.

datasets
--------
	{ dsname*, pdname*, pjname*, storm_id, user_processing, raw_data, final_data, 
	  station_info, software, plots, id_type, platform_type, status_notes, admin_notes, 
	  status, exclude, questions }
The {pdname, pjname} tuple is a foreign key of the products table.  The user_processing 
attribute is a foreign key of the users table.

extractions
-----------
	{ dsname*, pdname*, pjname*, pdsource, pjsource }
The {dsname, pdname, pjname } tuple is a foreign key of the datasets table.  The 
{pdsource, pjsource} tuple is a foreign key of the products table.  The application was 
written so that the pjname and the pjsource are always equivalent.  The pjsource was 
included in the database to maintain third normal form.  It is possible these two attributes 
will not be equivalent in the future but not likely.
