      Hly PCP to convert: Put NCDC Hrly pcp out as standalone then 
                          the datasets that form the HPC are done 
                          and out there standalone.

       *** No $$$ for work! ***

        NPN, DATSAV3, ASOS - Done
        AWOS - There's none available.
        HPCN - If sites in AOI, Put out raw as is? <-----DS
        ARMSFC - put out raw data "as is"? <----SL

        See 45.700 - CODIAC shows Remote link, but RB is to convert PDF (can't?)
          and load in-house data. has this been done? Put out data with PDF- 
          no readme.  This is an issue for G. Stossmeister to resolve. 
          See data loading notes.

      Project DONE except:

       NPN Hourly RASS - not available and not a primary need.

          LEC contacted NCDC (via order) and SFW talked to Wayne Faas.
          and LEC emailed Dan Manns who sent our request to 
          Alan Pihlak (Branch Chief) at NOAA FSL who said you have it 
          on the MESA who said ask Chi-Fan Shih. AP said Historical
          data would be available soon? JAG? checked out MESA data 
          availability plus LDM.    Bottom line: Historical data not yet 
          available, but should be some day at http://profiler.noaa.gov.

       COOP Soil Temp - DS will do as done for NE96.

             Tape drive ordered?

          ***** INDOEX: Satellite Meteosat-5 (TDF and NETCDF) - data found
                on tape, copied to mass store and available on Master List?
                TDF - yes, NETCDF - no.

                DW still asking GS/SFW about some other extraneous sat files
                from these same tapes. NetCDF not yet linked - still questions.


          Althausen - concerns about data acknowledgements. SFW emailed?

          Tanre - LEC sent Claude Devoux email for better readme and 
            same AOD data for KCO.


          SFW contacting Meywerk about ASD, BSI, MicroTops, and GPS data.
            Then will decide if this should be 4 different Radiation Meywerk 
                datasets.
            from ZIP disks #34 and #35a.


          SFW/GS found Daily Wx briefing overheads?

          Blank Model (NOGAPS, AVN) images being removed? DS and DW.

      Aircraft P-3 Meteorology Navigation and State Parmeters - Have
        Dave Raymond's conversion s/w with corrections. He will send
        us final converted data for EPIC?

      Jose will give me more info on how he wants the EPIC Master Page
      updated (such new data catagories, etc.). Have latest updates done.

      Otherwise, data loading up-to-date.
