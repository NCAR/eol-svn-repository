Hi John,

We've gone through the latest DATSAV3
data order that we received last week
and there still appears to be some missing data. 

Please take a look at: 
    http://www.joss.ucar.edu/~janine/datsav3/
and go to the *new* feb 2001 data plot.

You will see a missing band of data across
the upper mid and western states.  We are not
sure which WMO #'s this corresponds to, but these
stns are missing for the complete time period that
we requested.  

Also, we still need a more recent station list 
that will contain all the DATSAV3 stations. 
We've found that not all the stations
in the data you have sent are contained in the
older station lists we have.

For reference, I have included a copy of our current
order.  If there's anything else we can provide,
please let us know as we'd like to get these data
as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Linda Cully
