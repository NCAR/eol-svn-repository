The MSS Satellite query tool is a tool that was developed by Dan Sullivan for Greg to
maintain a database of the GOES satellite data that JOSS maintains on the MSS.

The files in the html directory are the static web page files that should be deployed
in /web/docs/satellite/query.  The files in the cgi-bin directory are the CGI scripts
that should be deployed in the /web/cgi-bin/dpg/mass_store directory.  The files in
the crontab directory were originally under the /home/suldan/mass_store directory, but
should be deployed somewhere else.  The files in the docs directory are Dan's original
documenation pages on the tool that he created before he left.
