Mass Store GOES Data summary
===========================

Note: This 'inventory' was compiled to give me and Don an idea of what was
on Mass Store before I began working on the application, may be of interest 
  -Dan 2004-04-22.

This is a quick summary of the GOES data on mass store.  I did not take the
time to determine all the days for which we have data but this will give the 
general idea.

General Notes:
	compression: sometime in 2002 - not sure when - the files are gzipped so
		the names contain the .gz on the end, before that there appears to be
		no zipping - according to Greg S. gzipping maybe began sometime in Jan.
	naming: the 1999 goes8 has a different naming convention than 2000,2001,2002.
		the file name begins with g8 instead of g08 - don't know why

Directory rundown:

/JOSS/DATA/RAW/SATELLITE/GOES:
	-Contains two subdirectories G10 and G08

	./G10:
		-Contains subdirs 1KM and 4KM
		-./G10/1KM
			-Broken down by year - 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002
			-Under each year there is a directory for everyday there is data
				-in the daily directories the files are in the format:
					g10.YYYYDDD.HHMM
			-There is also a directory ./G10/1KM/0209 - I'm not sure what this is, 
				but I don't think it is something to worry about.
		-./G10/4KM
			-1999, 2000, 2001, 2002
			-Same run down as the 1KM
			-./G10/1KM/0209 - another one of these - why?

	./G08
		-Similar to G10
		-Contains subdirs 1KM, 4KM and 8KM
		-./G08/1KM
			-1999, 2000, 2001, 2002
			-Each year has daily directories like goes10
			-1999:
				-On 6-7-2002 Becky was putting this data on mass store from tape
				-the File format is: g8.YYYYDDD.HHMM
			-2000,2001, and 2002
				-the File format is g08.YYYYDDD.HHMM
				-notice the difference compared to 1999!!
		-./G08/4KM
			-1999, 2000, 2001, 2002
			-Same run down as 1KM
			-Another random extra dir - 2021
		-./G08/8KM
			-Only 1999 with one day and one file	
		

goes_data.pl script:

This script was run to list all of the files for goes10 4KM 2002.  It was run
on day 158 of 2002.  The file generated is goes_stat.keep.txt.  It took about
an hour to list all of the files and determine some general stats about them. 
This was for only six months of one resolution of one satellite, so it may take
some time to populate a database if that is the plan.
