<h1>Uploading metadata and data for AON Projects</h1><p>An on-line interface has been established to permit the upload of metadata and data.  The url is: www.eol.car.edu/projects/aon-cadis   The upload site can be accessed via the links list (in gray) along the left side of the page or directly at http://cdp.ucar.edu/cadis </p><h2>Obtaining a CADIS User name and password</h2><p>++Details coming from Mike Burek++</p><h2>Logging  on</h2><p>Connect to the log-in page and provide user name and password.  Once you are logged in a 'short cuts link' will appear on the left side of the CADIS Portal page. You can enter metadata without uploading data (metadata will include a field that says where the data are) or, you can upload both metadata and data. You must provide a minimum set of required metadata before uploading a data file into CADIS.</p><p>Click on the new datasets link on the left to enter the metadata entry form.  Links on the left side will become operational as CADIS development continues.   You can cancel at any time but all of your work is erased and you will start over.  The help link will become active and updated as the user manual is completed.</p><h2>Entering metadata</h2><p>This section includes a description of how to fill out all the metadata fields for a data set using the CADIS metadata authoring interface. Before beginning, decide what collections of data will constitute individual data sets. You will be filling out metadata for each dataset submitted within a given AON project.  Please note that you must fill out the required fields (in red) on the form in order to upload a dataset.</p><p>Item 1. Project.  Choose from the drop down list of NSF funded projects.  Choose the project that funds your data collection, or that your data collection is in support of. Please contact Jim Moore or Florence Fetterer if you don't see your project or if you have questions. .  If there is an error in the project name please contact CADIS support (stott@ucar.edu) to correct the problem.</p><p>Item 2: Dataset title.  Please make this dataset title descriptive of the content. Put the most important words first, and don't include dates. Acronyms are OK. If the title doesn't fit in the entry window its probably too long.  Keep in mind that like the title of a research paper, the title of a data set may be used in a citation.  This is a required field.</p><p><a name="summary">Item 3:</a> Dataset Summary: This is a paragraph that describes the 'who what where when and why' of the dataset you are submitting with this metadata.   It will appear in the online AON data catalog.  Web crawlers will index this paragraph, and as a result the description provided here will assist others who are searching for data using a search engine and keyword search. This field can be typed in or simply cut and pasted from other existing information such as the summary from your NSF proposal.</p><p>Items 4 and 5: Begin and End date.  Choose from the drop down menus to provide the temporal coverage of the data set.  If hour and day of month are known, please include them, however, it is not essential.</p><p>Items 6-9   Minimum and Maximum Latitude and Longitude.  Please supply the values for spatial coverage that describe a box around your data set in term of minimum and maximum latitude and longitude.    If the data are at one geographical location only, enter the latitude and longitude of that point.  For a moving platform, use a box that bounds the track of the platform.   It is not necessary to be extremely precise if the information is not readily at hand, position to a tenth of a degree or even a degree is usually good enough.   Include vertical coverage, if applicable. The following guidelines from the GCMD may be useful. </p><p>Southermost_Latitude: The southernmost geographic latitude covered by the data. From: 0 - 90° North or 0 - 90° South.   For example, 60°N<p>Northernmost_Latitude: The northernmost geographic latitude covered by the data. From: 0 - 90° North or 0 - 90° South.<p>Westernmost_Longitude: The westernmost geographic longitude covered by the data. From: 0 - 180° East or 0 - 180° West. The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, measured positive (+) eastwards of the PM. For example, 45°W.<p>Easternmost_Longitude: The easternmost geographic longitude covered by the data. From: 0 - 180° east or 0 - 180° west. The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, measured positive (+) eastwards of the PM. <p>Minimum_Altitude: The altitude level, which represents the lower limit of data coverage. Units can be specified. For example 10km.<p>Maximum_Altitude: The altitude level, which represents the higher limit of data coverage. Units can be specified. For example, 100km<p>Minimum_Depth: The depth level, which represents the upper-most depth of data coverage. Units can be specified. For example, 100m<p>Maximum_Depth: The depth level, which represents the lowest depth of data coverage. Units can be specified.. For example, 1000m</p><p>Item 10. Location keyword .  Choose the one that fits best.</p><p>Item 11. Discipline. Choose the one that fits best.  These are used to group AON datasets at a high level.</p><p>Item 12: Frequency. Choose from the drop down menu to indicate the temporal resolution of the dataset. When there is more than one choice, choose the frequency that best approximates the sampling frequency for your data</p><p>Item 13. Spatial Type: Choose the data type that most closely matches your data. </p><p>Item 14. Resolution. For most data sets, simply type in the spatial resolution (horizontal as well as vertical, if applicable). If you cannot be precise, choose from the ranges given by the GCMD keywords below.  For some data sets (gridded satellite image data, for example), resolution can be harder to define.   Just choose a resolution that best describes the data. You can include more detailed information in documentation you provide.</p><p>Item 15. Platform Keyword.  Choose the platform or platforms for the instruments that acquired the data.  </p><p>Item 16. Instrument name. Choose from the list or enter the name or names of the instrument.   If known, include the brand as well. </p><p>Item 17. Science Keyword. Choose from the NASA Global Change Master Directory list of topic areas or parameters. </p><p>Item 18. ISO topic.  Select one or more of the topic categories.  Using these helps your data set's metadata to be ISO compliant. This may be useful in the future for international data sharing.  </p><p>Item 19. Metadata Contact The drop down menu includes PIs for the projects.  You can enter a different name if needed. This is person who is responsible for the content of the metadata record. Generally, this will be the person filling out the form. If the responsibility shifts from the original author to another person (e.g. from an investigator to a data manager), the field should be updated to the new responsible person. This is so if a question comes up about the metadata, we know who to ask.</p><p>Item 20. Data Center Contact The person (or Help Desk, or data center itself) who is responsible for the distribution of the data. If data are submitted to CADIS, this will be Don Stott. If data are kept elsewhere, and only metadata are submitted to CADIS, it will be the person responsible for the data. </p><p>Item 21 Data Access:  A description of how to get to your data. If you submit data to CADIS, leave this blank.  Otherwise, this will usually be a link to a page that conveys both how and where to get the data.  Please specify if the link is a service, such as OpenDAP.  </p><p>Item 22  Distribution format.  Remember that ASCII is not a format in the metadata sense.  You need to be more specific.  This is a required field.</p><p>Item 23  Progress.  This is meant to describe the state of the data being submitted  where Planned refers to data sets to be collected in the future and are thus unavailable at the present time, in-work means preliminary or on-going,  and complete means final, that is, data sets in which no updates or further data collection will be made.  </p><p>Item 24 Data Tags  These are other unique identifiers.  This allows you to add other unique tags (e.g. more specific discipline, project related IOP or station number) or other remarks on your datasets that may help in locating and using these data.</p><p>Item 25-27  Additional dataset details.  We have assumed that all AON datasets are unrestricted in access once they are placed in the CDP.  If you do not want such open access, you must speak with the NSF manager about exceptions.</p><h2>Preview Page</h2><p>After you have completed the 27 item metadata entry form, please hit the Submit metadata for a dataset button at the bottom of the page.  CADIS now reviews your metadata entry for completeness. If you have made an error or omission, you are alerted to this with a red box at the top of the form highlighting problem areas as well as a red box around the specific item in error.    Please correct them at this time.  Hit the Submit metadata for a dataset button to continue the submission preview.  </p><p>You will be brought to the Show Dataset Metadata page where you now review your complete metadata in a list form.  If you are satisfied, hit the Submit this dataset to CADIS button on the left or at the bottom of the page.  This may take a moment.Remember, it is possible for you to edit the metadata at any time during this session or by re-entering the CADIS data/metadata upload site.</p><h2>Uploading Data</h2><p>After submitting the metadata you will see a confirmation page that includes next steps along the left side labeled "Actions for the Dataset".  As noted above, you may edit the metadata using the link.  You will see the same forms as before.</p>
