<h1>Uploading Metadata and Data for AON 
Projects</h1>
<p>An on-line interface has 
been established to permit the upload of metadata 
and data. The url is: 
www.eol.car.edu/projects/aon-cadis. The upload 
site can be accessed via the links list (in gray) 
along the left side of the page or directly at 
http://cdp.ucar.edu/cadis .</p>
<h2>Obtaining 
a CADIS User Name and Password</h2>
<p>
Accounts have been set up on the CADIS site for lead PIs of projects included in CADIS. Project 
PIs can expect an email from CADIS support staff with user name and initial passwords, and 
instructions on changing passwords. Project data areas have been set up, as well, under the SEARCH
project categories. PIs may designate "metadata contacts" who may create and edit metadata for datasets,                
upload data to datasets, and handle other administrative functions related to making data available on the CADIS portal.  
Detailed instructions on designating "metadata contacts" will be in the initial email.                     
Please contact CADIS support 
(<a href="mailto:cadis@eol.ucar.edu">cadis@eol.ucar.edu</a>) 
if you need further instructions for accessing the portal.
</p>
<h2>Logging On and Navigating</h2>
<p>Connect 
to the log-in page and provide user name and 
password. Once you are logged in links will 
appear on the left side of the page.</p>
<p>You can enter metadata without 
uploading data (metadata will include a field 
that says where the data are) or, you can upload 
both metadata and data. You must provide a 
minimum set of required metadata before uploading 
a data file into CADIS.</p>
<p>Click on one 
of the links under Metadata for Datasets to enter 
the metadata entry form.</p>
<h2>Entering 
metadata</h2>
<p>This section includes a 
description of how to fill out all the metadata 
fields for a data set using the CADIS metadata 
authoring interface. Before beginning, decide 
what collections of data will constitute 
individual data sets. You will be filling out 
metadata for each dataset submitted within a 
given AON project.</p>
<p>Please note that 
you must fill out the required fields (in red) on 
the form in order to upload a dataset. You can 
cancel at any time but all of your work is erased 
and you will start over. A better idea may be to 
fill the required fields with anything, then save 
the metadata. You can then retrieve it later and 
continue working.</p>
<p>A quick way to enter 
metadata is to use an existing metadata record as 
a template. You can use any of the metadata 
records that you have access to for this purpose.
To do this, choose a dataset from the list of datasets
previously submitted. Edit the record as needed, changing the title of the
dataset as a minumum. 
Then scroll to the bottom and click on 
"Create metadata for a new dataset using this one as a 
template".</p>
<p>The metadata fields, taken 
together, make up the CADIS metadata profile. 
CADIS metadata are compatible with (that is, they 
can be mapped to) other medata standards 
including the NASA Global Change Master 
Directory's (GCMD) Directory Interchange Format 
(DIF) and the International Polar Year metadata 
profile. The CADIS metadata is most like DIF 
metadata, with a few extra fields. Many DIF and 
CADIS fields are identical, and we have drawn 
heavily on the pioneering work of the GCMD 
project for the CADIS profile and this metadata 
authoring tool. The <a 
href="http://gcmd.nasa.gov/User/difguide/difman.html">Directory 
Interchange Format (DIF) Writer's Guide</a> has 
information and examples for many fields that you 
may find useful.</p>
<p>Item 1. <a name="Project"></a><strong>Project</strong>. 
Choose from the drop down list of NSF funded 
projects. Choose the project that funds your data 
collection, or that your data collection is in 
support of. Please contact Jim Moore or Florence 
Fetterer if you don't see your project or if you 
have questions. If there is an error in the 
project name please contact CADIS support 
(<a href="mailto:cadis@eol.ucar.edu">cadis@eol.ucar.edu</a>) to correct the problem.</p>
<p>Item 2. <a name="Title"></a><strong>Dataset Title</strong>. Please make this 
dataset title descriptive of the content. Put the 
most important words first, and do not include 
dates. Acronyms are OK. If the title doesn't fit 
in the entry window it is probably too long. Keep 
in mind that like the title of a research paper, 
the title of a data set may be used in a 
citation.</p>
<p>Item 3. <a name="Summary"></a><strong>Dataset Summary</strong>. 
This is a paragraph that describes the 'who, 
what, where, when, and why' of the dataset you 
are submitting with this metadata. It will appear 
in the online AON data catalog. Web crawlers will 
index this paragraph, and as a result the 
description provided here will assist others who 
are searching for data using a search engine and 
keyword search. This field can be typed in or 
simply cut and pasted from other existing 
information such as the summary from your NSF 
proposal (but remember, it should describe the 
dataset, not the project as a whole).</p>
<p>Items <a name="Date"></a>4 and 5. <strong>Begin and End date</strong>. Choose from 
the drop down menus to provide the temporal 
coverage of the data set. If hour and day of 
month are known, please include them, however, it 
is not essential.</p>
<p>Items <a name="LatLong"></a>6-9. <strong>Minimum 
and Maximum Latitude and Longitude</strong>. Please supply 
the values for spatial coverage that describe a 
box around your data set in term of minimum and 
maximum latitude and longitude. If the data are 
at one geographical location only, enter the 
latitude and longitude of that point. For a 
moving platform, use a box that bounds the track 
of the platform. It is not necessary to be 
extremely precise if the information is not 
readily at hand, position to a tenth of a degree 
or even a degree is usually good enough. The 
following guidelines from the GCMD may be 
useful.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Southermost_Latitude</strong>: The southernmost 
geographic latitude covered by the data. From: 0 
- 90 deg North or 0 - 90 deg South. For example, 
60</p>
  <p><strong>Northernmost_Latitude</strong>: The 
northernmost geographic latitude covered by the 
data. From: 0 - 90 deg North or 0 - 90 deg 
South.</p>
  <p><strong>Westernmost_Longitude</strong>: The 
westernmost geographic longitude covered by the 
data. From: 0 - 180 deg East or 0 - 180 deg West. 
The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, measured 
positive (+) eastwards of the PM. For example, 45 
deg W.</p>
  <p><strong>Easternmost_Longitude</strong>: The 
easternmost geographic longitude covered by the 
data. From: 0 - 180 deg east or 0 - 180 deg west. 
The Prime Meridian is 0 degrees, measured 
positive (+) eastwards of the PM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Item <a name="Location"></a>10. <strong>Location Keyword</strong>. 
Choose the one that fits best.</p>
<p>Item 
  <a name="Discipline"></a>11. <strong>Discipline</strong>. Choose the one that fits best. 
These are used to group AON datasets at a high 
level.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Frequency"></a>12. <strong>Frequency</strong>. Choose from 
the drop down menu to indicate the temporal 
resolution of the dataset. When there is more 
than one choice, choose the frequency that best 
approximates the sampling frequency for your 
data</p>
<p>Item <a name="Spatial"></a>13. <strong>Spatial Type</strong>. Choose the 
data type that most closely matches your 
data.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Resolution"></a>14. <strong>Resolution</strong>.Choose from the ranges 
given by the GCMD keywords. For some data 
sets (gridded satellite image data, for example), 
resolution can be harder to define. Just choose a 
resolution that best describes the data. You can 
include more detailed information in 
documentation you provide.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Platform"></a>15. 
  <strong>Platform Keyword</strong>. Choose the platform or 
platforms for the instruments that acquired the 
data.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Instrument"></a>16. <strong>Instrument Name</strong>. Choose 
from the list. The last choice is "other" if the instrument is not in the list.
</p>
<p>Item <a name="Science"></a>17. <strong>Science Keyword</strong>. Choose 
from the NASA Global Change Master Directory list 
of topic areas or parameters.</p>
<p>Item <a name="ISO"></a>18. 
  <strong>ISO Topic</strong>. Select one of the topic 
categories. Using these helps your data set's 
metadata to be ISO compliant. This may be useful 
in the future for international data 
sharing.</p>
<p>Item <a name="MetaContact"></a>19. <strong>Metadata Contact</strong>. 
The drop down menu includes PIs for the projects. 
You can enter a different name if needed. This is 
person who is responsible for the content of the 
metadata record. Generally, this will be the 
person filling out the form. If the 
responsibility shifts from the original author to 
another person (e.g. from an investigator to a 
data manager), the field should be updated to the 
new responsible person. This is so if a question 
comes up about the metadata, we know who to 
ask.</p>
<p>Item <a name="DataContact"></a>20. <strong>Data Center Contact</strong>. The 
person (or Help Desk, or data center itself) who 
is responsible for the distribution of the data. 
If data are submitted to CADIS, this will be Don 
Stott. If data are kept elsewhere, and only metadata 
are submitted to CADIS, it will be the person 
responsible for the data.</p>
<p>Item <a name="DataAccess"></a>21. 
  <strong>Data Access</strong>. A description of how to get to your 
data. If you submit data to CADIS, leave this 
blank. Otherwise, this will usually be a link to 
a page that conveys both how and where to get the 
data. </p>
<p>Item <a name="Format"></a>22. <strong>Distribution 
Format</strong>. Remember that ASCII is not a format in 
the metadata sense. You need to be more specific. 
This is a required field.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Progress"></a>23. 
  <strong>Progress</strong>. This is meant to describe the state of 
the data being submitted where Planned refers to 
data sets to be collected in the future and are 
thus unavailable at the present time, in-work 
means preliminary or on-going, and complete means 
final, that is, data sets in which no updates or 
further data collection will be made.</p>
<p>Item <a name="DataTags"></a>24. <strong>Data Tags</strong>. These are other unique 
identifiers. This allows you to add other unique 
tags (e.g. more specific discipline, project 
related IOP or station number) or other remarks 
on your datasets that may help in locating and 
using these data.</p>
<p>Items <a name="Xlink"></a>25. &amp; 26. <strong> Related Resources</strong>
References (citations) to work that uses the data, and link to full product documentation go here. 
Users will insert a URL or citation, then tag it with what category it falls in using dropdowns. 
 </p>
<p>Item <a name="Language"></a>27. <strong>Dataset 
Language</strong>. If the dataset (data and/or 
documentation) is in a language other than 
English, please enter the language.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Restrictions"></a>28. <strong>Access Restrictions</strong>. We have assumed 
that all AON datasets are unrestricted in access 
once they are uploaded to the CADIS data server. 
If you do not want such open access, you must 
speak with the NSF manager about exceptions. 
These may include any special restrictions, legal 
prerequisites, limitations and/or warnings on 
obtaining the data set. <a 
href="http://gcmd.nasa.gov/User/difguide/access_constraints.html">Additional 
information and examples from GCMD</a>.</p>
<p>Item <a name="Constraints"></a>29. <strong>Use Constraints</strong>. Here one may 
describe how the data may or may not be used 
after access is granted to assure the protection 
of privacy or intellectual property.  This 
includes any special restrictions, legal 
prerequisites, terms and conditions, and/or 
limitations on using the data set.  Data 
providers may request acknowledgement of the data 
from users and claim no responsibility for 
quality and completeness of data. <a 
href="http://gcmd.nasa.gov/User/difguide/use_constraints.html">Additional 
information from GCMD</a>.</p>
<h2>Preview 
Page</h2>
<p>After you have completed the 29 
item metadata entry form, click the "Save metadata 
for new dataset" button at the bottom of the 
page. If you started with a previously submitted 
metadata record, use the "Create a new dataset 
using this as a template" button. CADIS now 
reviews your metadata entry for completeness. If 
you have made an error or omission, you are 
alerted to this with a red box at the top of the 
form highlighting problem areas as well as a red 
box around the specific item in error. Please 
correct them at this time. Click on the Submit 
metadata for a dataset button once more to continue the 
submission preview.</p>
<p>You will be 
brought to the Review Dataset Metadata page where 
you now review your complete metadata in a list 
form. If you are satisfied, click the Submit this 
dataset to CADIS button on the left or at the 
bottom of the page. This may take a moment. 
Remember, it is possible for you to edit the 
metadata at any time during this session or by 
re-entering the CADIS data/metadata upload 
site.</p>
<h2>Uploading Data</h2>
<p>After submitting the metadata you will see a 
confirmation page that includes next steps along 
the left side labeled "Actions for the Dataset". 
As noted above, you may edit the metadata using 
the link. You will see the same forms as 
before.</p>
