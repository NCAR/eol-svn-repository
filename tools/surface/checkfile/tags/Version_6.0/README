Version1 - contains a copy of the original "Lia Pennington"
	version of the check_QCF_file s/w modified to compile
        under CC.  See the top of check_QCF_file.c for a list
        of mods made.

Version2 - contains an updated version of the check_QCF_file s/w
	that has been modified to catch "NaN"'s in the QCF record
	and that does not accept 'N' as a valid Squall/Gust Indicator
	QC flag.  This agrees with the hourly surface composite
	documentation that is published on CD.

Version3 - Verifies that if the Calculated Sea Level Pressure
        is missing the flag must be 'I'. Since this is
        always a calculated value, it can only have flags of
        U, G, D, B, I.

Version4 - Does not issue warnings for missing elevations.  Does issue
	warnings for negative zero values. Issues each complete warning,
	including the record number, on a single line.

Version5 - Oct 2000 - Checks records with either 2- or 4-digit years,
	but not both in the same file.

Version6 - Mar 2003/Jul 2005 - Includes two modifications:
   On 21 Mar 2003 jag - 
   Increased acceptable visibility to 160000m (just under 100SM).
   Visibilities of up to 90SM are commonly seen in the West, an
   area which is now showing up in our projects (i.e. IHOP).
   On 18 Jul 2005 jag
   Increased acceptable visibility to 160934.41 (100SM).
   Visibilities of 100SM can occur in the West, an
   area which is now showing up in our projects (i.e. NAME).
