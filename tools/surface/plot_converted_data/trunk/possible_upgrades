Here are the things we would like to add to this code eventually:

1) The code splits the data to plot on spaces, so fields that contain a space 
will cause the code to bomb.  The notable case of this is "Rec rainga" data.  
User must change Rec rainga to Rec:rainga in the input data in order for 
plotting to work.  The fix for this will require a fundamental change in the 
code.

2) Create a web front end for plot_ceop.pl so anyone can create plots of
qcf- and ceop- formatted data.

3) When raw data are zipped it is tempting to do something like:
zmore *.qcf.gz | plot_ceop.pl qcf ..... -d -.  This does not work because 
as the code stands, the input file is gone through twice - once to determine
all stations/heights/CSEid's in the data, and then again to pull out just the
data we want to plot.  Not sure if this is worth fixing (or even possible to
fix).

4) Make yranges input-able by user rather than hardcoded.

5) If you put in conflicting flags (like -c and -m) I'm not sure what you'll 
get. Have code handle this more gracefully in the future.

6) Add station lat/lon/elev to title of plot.

7) Can the code be easily upgraded to deal with R-justified fields?
