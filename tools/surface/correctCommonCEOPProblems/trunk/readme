Update the correct_CEOP_EOP3_data.pl s/w from "JOSS" references
to "EOL" references. Since the user should always use this code
to make the corrections, I didn't check or correct any of the
other s/w that corrections only individual types of data formats.

----------------------------------
This dir contains some code to "correct" simple
and common problems found with CEOP EOP3 data formats.
Use the s/w that corrects all data types. Started by
creating s/w that just corrected the sfc and then the
flux, then created the s/w that corrects all data types.
