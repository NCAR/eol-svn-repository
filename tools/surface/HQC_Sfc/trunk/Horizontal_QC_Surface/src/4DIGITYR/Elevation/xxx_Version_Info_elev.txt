19Jan07SAVE_elev/ - First version of the HQC that uses Elevation to determine QC flagging.
                    Prior to Jan 1007, the version of HQC using Elevation did not exist.

29May07SAVE_elev/ - Second copy of "first" version. Just prior to adding in check if wdsp>gust
                    then reset gust flag to "D". All subsequent versions should have this 
                    check added.

Source found in this dir is always a copy of the most current version of the HQC that DOES 
use Elevation to determine the QC flags.
