Update HQC s/w so not overwrite I flag
if it occurs for station pressure. Now the
DATSAV2 stn pressure is calculated from
the altimeter and elevation so it can be
-999.99 I. This s/w has not yet been
tested.

Consider:

Add in check for negative precip and
for values too large to fit in field.
In these cases set the prcflg to "C".

LEC   16 Nov 98
------------------------------------------
The above should be checked and found
by the check_QCF_file.c program. QC should
not have to check for these items.

But we now have Mobile stations that we
should HQC. ID these stations by "DATSAV2M"
and "GLERLM".  Let variances be computed.
This way we can see how stable these stations
are. (We don't expect them to be stable or
stationary at all, but this might help ID
sites that were mis-ID'd as being mobile.)
Skip the mobile stations in the main_qc.c
program. Then if want, we could actually
QC this data should someone want to.

Also ensure that MAXNUMSTNS in local.h
is large enough to be = or > the total
number of stns in this composite.
