The notes below the dashed line are VERY OLD
and basically should be ignored. In September
2002, I updated this F77 s/w to handle 4 digit
year and corrected the leap year check. This
new s/w has the "_4DYR" on the end of the file
names to indicate 4 digit year changes were made.
The new 4 Digit Yr s/w is now called:
runstnstat_4DYR, stnstat_4DYR.sc, and stnstat_4DYR.
See the 4DigitYear directory for the latest s/w.

This is an old note - but parts are
probably still important - especially
the location of the best src.

This s/w must be updated when the begin
and end dates of a project change. Update
the FIRSTDAY and LASTDAY variables in the
qcglobal.h file. Then update the NUMDAYS
var (if required). NUMDAYS is located in
stnstatcom.h.

stnstat must be recompiled in the data8 area
listed below by issuing the following command:

make -f Makeqc stnstat

---------------------------------------------

This dir contains the best stnstats program
executable. It was formed by updating the
stnstat.f s/w in /data8/vortex/QC/1995_QC_WORK/src to
show HQC instead of MAPS as the processing
method. The s/w was recompiled over there.
Only the executable is located here.

LEC 4 Oct 1995 (Updated lec 15 Oct 1998)

Note that a copy of the src is now located
in the SRC subdirectory here.
