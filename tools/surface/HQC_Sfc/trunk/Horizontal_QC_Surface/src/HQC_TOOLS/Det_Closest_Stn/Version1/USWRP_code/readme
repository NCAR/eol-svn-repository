The code in this area was used to process the USWRP station list info
found in /work/STNLISTS/USWRP . There are only very minor diffs between
this and the original version of the s/w. For instance, the number of lines
to be printed in the output web page was set to be 46 which will cause all
stations to be printed for each considered station. The AOI was set to 
3000 KM so that all stns would be considered for each station.
