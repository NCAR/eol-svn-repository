Software locations for rest of ESOP95/SW Tasks
----------------------------------------------

1. NCDC COOP data conversion.

	/data8/gist/ncdc_coop/src - RIS has recompiled s/w.
				Believe that RIS created a tool
				to check this daily sfc output.
	Done in GIST by RIS.

2. Extract 15 minute precip from 5 min sfc Composite.

	Checkout from CVS the module precip_cvts
	(Precip_cvts points to /raid3/spare/john/precip_cvts
	See qpq5 program. Read the Readme.precip file.
	Done in GIST by JA.

3. Extract hrly precip from hrly sfc Composite.

        Checkout from CVS the module precip_cvts
        (Precip_cvts points to /raid3/spare/john/precip_cvts
        See qpq60 program. Read the Readme.precip file.
	Done in GIST by JA.

4. Form Daily Precip from hrly precip Composite.

	/data10/cully/PRECIP/src/hrly2daily.c, also check
	/data8/gids/dailyprecip/PRECOMP/hrly2daily.c. Diff
	the s/w in these areas. LEC fixed 3 simple warnings
	in the /data8 area. To run the s/w do:
	   hrly2daily -i infile -o outfile -d DMIN -b BMAX

	where DMIN = 101.6mm and BMAX = 127.0 mm for ESOP95 Daily precip.
	Done in GIST by djr and LEC.

5. ARS sfc extract 15min precip?? Never done before???
	See /data6/ocs.

6. ARS hrly precip conversion - last used in STORMFEST.

        Checkout from CVS the module precip_cvts
        (Precip_cvts points to /raid3/spare/john/precip_cvts
        See ars.c program. Read the Readme.precip and
        the readme.txt files.
	Done in STORMFEST by JA.
 
7. NCDC Wind Profiler conversion. This is not the sfc data.

	See /spare1/john/profplot. See eb2prof.c to convert 
        (verify with J.Allison) and wp915.c to plot on terminal.

	The ESOP95 data is located: /raid2/ES*/wpdn_w60/src_data.
	This dataset must first be subset to our AOI (and timeframe?).
	Done in GIST by JA.

8. Convert 5min QCF to hrly QCF.

	/data10/iowa_1min/FIVEtoHOUR/updated_fivm2hrly.f

9. Convert 1min QCF to 5min QCF.

	/data10/iowa_1min/ONEtoFIVE/convert_OnetToFive.c

10. Divide QCF, PQCF, NCDC COOP, etc files into day/mo files.

	/data10/cully/PRECIP/src

11. Note that many tools for stnlists, qcf, postprocs, etc are
    located in /data10/cully/TOOLS/ and /raid/NE*/src/GENERAL_*/.

	The s/w to remove_okmeso.c is located here.
