        How_to_compute_HQC_ranges

1. If there are no Mobile networks in data,
run:    
       >  compute_var_cts


To compute the HQC range limits needed to fill
in table 3.2 Ranges of HQC flag limit values for 
the current project. The use must run the C program
"compute_var_cts.c" on all the SIGMASQ (variance) files
created during the HQC of the surface data being
studied.  This C program expects a file named "file_list.txt"
as input which contains a list of all the SIGMASQ
files to be processed.  The compute_var_cts program
processes each file and "bins" each variance read
by parameter. Once all the SIGMASQ files have been
processed, compute_var_cts uses an algorithm to
determine the span of "bins" that contains 95% of
the SIGMASQ values. It them uses these 95% limits
to compute high and low end ranges and the table
values for HQC Table 3-2.  The user should do a 
quick verification to ensure that they agree with
the program output in file var_ct.out.  Note that
the user may decide to modify the "bins" in the
C program and rerun to generate different or
more exact results. The user should read the final
output and warnings in the the output file var_ct.out
before publishing the HQC flag limit values.


2) If there are Mobile networks, first remove the
Mobile sigma values, then run compute_var_cts:

   >  create_nonMobile_sigmaFiles.pl
   >  compute_var_cats

If the user determines that the original SIGMASQ files
contained values for mobile sites (DATSAV2M or GLERLM)
then the user may wish to create another set of SIGMASQ
files and then redo the HQC flag limit values. To do this,
the user MUST create a directory named "NOMOBILE" in
the are in which they will be running (generally the
SIGMASQ area). Then the user can run the PERL script
"create_nonMobile_sigmaFiles.pl" which will fill the 
NOMOBILE area with duplicate SIGMASQ files which have
had all the non_missing mobile site variances changed
to -888.88. The user can then rerun the compute_var_cts.c
program on the NOMOBILE SIGMASQ files.

If the user simply wants to see how many non-missing
mobile variances were computed in the SIGMASQ files,
the user can run the "find_mobile_vars.pl" PERL script
on the SIGMASQ files.  Redirect the output from this
program to a file so that the results may be studied
earlier.  Generally, the user will find that because
of the nature of mobile sites that many will not even
have non-missing variance values and so they have little
impact on the HQC range limits which are computed.
