The new det begin and end PERL
scripts seem to both give the
same results. I think the first
(original) script is actually faster
when it maintains 2 seperate hash
tables over the new version that
maintains 1 hash table of arrays
with the begin and end dates in
the arrays. part of the slowness
may be due to how I "delete" and
re-add to keys in the new version.
There's probably a way to just update
an element in the arrays, but I
don't know how, yet.
