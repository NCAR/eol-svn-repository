Notes on the Horizontal Quality Control (HQC) processing
--------------------------------------------------------

This area contains the latest versions of the Horizontal Quality Control Surface code. 
Most of the code was written in the C language. The original processing of data 
took place from 1993 through several years including for the GCIP, BAMEX projects. 

This version of the software was taken from the /net/work/software/HQC/NEWQC/src/STNSTAT_TOOLS
area on the Mercury server in early June 2025 and is believed to be the best version.
In that same area, there are samples input and output and other versions of the process
that were applied and/or tested. 

The original HQC processing also depended on the cosort tool to sort the data for processing.
The cosort tool is no longer available on the systems. 


You can find descriptions of the process in the EOLDMS wiki at
