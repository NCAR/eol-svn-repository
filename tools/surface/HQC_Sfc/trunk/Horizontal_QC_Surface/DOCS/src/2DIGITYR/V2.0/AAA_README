The following list contains the 
differences between V1.0 and V2.0
of the HQC s/w:

 - Function locate_sigmasq() has
been updated to handle the searching
done in the last SIGMA_PERIOD (30)
days differently. This fn will now
search the complete (last) SIGMA_PERIOD
days when searching for a sigmasq value
for a day within the last SIGMA_PERIOD
days. The s/w searches forward from the
day for which the search request was made.
If the s/w hits the end of the project
before searching SIGMA_PERIOD days, the s/w
will continue searching at a date (SIGMA_PERIOD-
number of days searched) prior to the end
of the project. The searching process is cyclic.

Example: Given that the project ends on julian
day 181. Given searching for sigmasq value
for day 180.

Search process: If sigmasq located on day 181,
searching complete. If value can not be located
on day 181, searching will continue back on
day 152 and will continue forward until day 179.
(i.e., the complete month of june will be searched.)
