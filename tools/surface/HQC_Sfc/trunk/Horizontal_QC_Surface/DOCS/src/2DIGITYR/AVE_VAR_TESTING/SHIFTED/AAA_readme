This dir contains the data used to plot
the ave sigmas and to determine why day
121 ave sigmas showed a pattern so 
different from all other days. Turns out
that the different pattern is a result
of the searching done during the first
30 days of HQC processing.

The orig (raw) sigmasq files were re
recreated for day 121 and plotted (NoSrch files).
This data showed the expected pattern.

The raw sigmasq files for day 121 are located:
/raid/VORTEX95/SOLAR_SIGMAFILES/ORIG_raw121SIGFILES
