WARNING: This version 3 of the checker code has not been used
to actually check data. It is incomplete. See the "HERE" 's in 
the code. IMPORTANT: An error was found in version2 and that's
the correction that produced version4 which is a running version
of the s/w. Search for "legal" and compare the debug with version 4
to ensure total correction. Only error was in debug printout.
