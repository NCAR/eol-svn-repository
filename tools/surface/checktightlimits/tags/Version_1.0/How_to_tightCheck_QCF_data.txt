	How to Tight Check QCF Surface Data
	-----------------------------------

This level of checking is used to do a finer check of the 
individual parameters in the JOSS Quality Control Format (QCF)
for the Surface data only. The s/w is almost identical to
the check_QCF_file s/w (see "How to Check QCF Surface Data")
but with tighter gross limit checks.  The table below shows
the tighter limits applied to each parameter. The user should
check the actual s/w to ensure the applied limits. This s/w also
performs all the other checks that check_QCF_file does, plus
a few more (e.g., issue warning if dew point is greater than
temperature).  This s/w will produce (in general) more output than
any of the other QCF checkers. Record numbers, network, stn id,
date and time are included in the warning and error messages. 
This s/w should be executed after all other checkers have been run
on the data and after all major data problems have been corrected.


The source and executable s/w is located in the
"/data8/vortex/QC/checktightlimits/Version1/" area.


To execute this s/w, issue the following command:
> check_QCF_tightlimits <input_file_name>
