Version1 (check_QCF_dups.pl) contains a copy of the original checker written by
Janine Goldstein 2/25/99 with bug fixes found during the initial testing phase.

Version2 (check_QCF_dupsy2k.pl) works with qcf records that have 4-digit years.

If you make changes to the Y2K (4-digit year version) you may also want to update
the pre-Y2K (2-digit year version).

How_to_Check_QCF_dups is now in Plone.  Please make changes to it there.
