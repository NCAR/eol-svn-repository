		How to Check QCF Surface Data
		-----------------------------

	There are two programs/levels of checks that should be applied
	to all QCF surface data. These checks should be applied at the
        earliest possible level to help catch problems in the earliest
        stages of data conversion. Generally, the check_QCF_file is 
        applied before executing the check_QCF_comp program. The two
        QCF checking programs are described below. Note that for the
        NESOB96 data processing, a program called check_ext_QCF_comp
        (and associated process_ext_qcfrec files) was created to check
        this "extended" QCF data. For the first 255 chars, the "extended"
        QCF records are identical to the QCF records. There are 30 additional
        chars added to the end of the QCF records to give an extended record.
        Three variables and QC flags (U and V wind components and specific
        humidity) are in the 30 additional chars. Run the check_ext_QCF_comp
        the same as for check_QCF_comp. The software for the extended
        format is currently located at /work/0/DPG_HTML/BEST_SW/GENERAL_TOOLS/
        add_and_check_extended_QCF_format.

	1. check_QCF_file.c - This s/w checks the station information
           and each parameter within the QCF record that would normally
           be quality controlled. Gross limit checks are applied to
           each parameter, as well as some simple consistency checks
           between the data values and the data flags.

           Warning are issued for values that fall outside the
           limits, but the data are NOT changed. The check_QCF_file
           program is currently located in /rraid1/DPG_HTML/BEST_SW/GENERAL_TOOLS/checkfile/.
           See check-files.sh and check_QCF_file in that directory.

           The check_QCF_file program applies the following limits
           when performing gross limit checks:

           Parameter		Min Limit	Max Limit
           --------------------------------------------------
           elevation	       -200.00		9000.00
           latitude  		-90.00 		  90.00
           longitude 	       -180.00 		 180.00
           pressure  		300.00 		1200.00
           seaLvlPressure  	800.00 		1200.00
           CalcSeaLvlPressure 	800.00 		1200.00
           temperature 	       -100.00 		 100.00
           dewPoint    	       -100.00 		 100.00
           windSpeed 		  0.0 		 200.00
           windDir   		  0.0 		 360.00
           precipitation 	  0.0 		9999.99
           squallGust 		  0.0 		9999.99
           visibility 		  0.0 	       99999.99
           ceilingHeight1 	  0.0 		9999.99
           ceilingHeight2 	  0.0 		9999.99
           ceilingHeight3 	  0.0 		9999.99
           ceilingFlag		 10 		  15
           ceilingFlag		 20		  15
           ceilingFlag		 30 		  15
           cloudAmount		 10		  15
           cloudAmount		 20 		  15
           cloudAmount		 30 		  15

           The check_QCF_file program applies the following consistency
           checks:

           - If the flag indicates that the value should be missing (M,N,I,C)
             or unrecorded, check the value is equal to the missing
             value -999.99.

           - Check a date string to see if it contains a valid date in the
             form YY/MM/DD where YY is the 2-digit year, MM is the 2-digit
             month, and DD is the 2-digit day

           - Check a time string to see if it contains a valid time in the
             form HH:MM where HH is the 2-digit hour and MM is the 2-digit
             number of minutes past the hour.

	To execute the check_QCF_file program, issue the following command:

	 > check_QCF_file <input_file_name>


	2. check_QCF_comp.c - This program was written to check the final
           QCF surface data composites, but the user may find it useful to
           execute this program on individual dataset day files. This
           program assumes and so checks for the following:

           - Data records are in QC format (QCF).
           - Data is sorted by date/time and then lat/lon.
             Time (hr/min) is increasing in file.
             If times are the same, then lat/lon in increasing.
           - Each input file is a day file and contains only the
             data for that day. File name must match date of
             data in file.
           - Input file names contain: YYMMDD
             where YY = year, MM = month, DD = day. File suffix is
             generally qcf (can be 0qc).
           - Data records are unique. Duplicate records are flagged
           - Flags impossible dates such as 2/30, 2/31, 4/31, etc.
           - All hours (00 through 23) are present in file.
           - File contains only data at specified frequency. Frequency
             is specified in "data_freq.in" file.


           The check_QCF_comp program prints general statistics to stnd 
           output whether or not any errors are found in the data. The
           printed stats include: 
               - Number of records processed.
               - First and last times in file.
               - List of all different Networks present in data.

           Warnings are issued when the above checks fail, but data
           are NOT changed. The check_QCF_comp program is currently
           located in /rraid1/DPG_HTML/BEST_SW/GENERAL_TOOLS/checkcomp.


           Note that this program requires an additional file (named
           "data_freq.in")to processing any input files. The "data_freq.in"
           file contains two lines.  The first line contains one integer
           number that is the data frequency expected in the input file. This
           should be the highest occuring frequency in the data. For 20 minute
           data the number "20" should be on the first line of "data_freq.in".
           The second line contains the position in the input file name that
           the date (i.e., YYMMDD) begins.  If the file is named 940401.qcf,
           then the second line should contain a zero. If the file is named
           OKMESO5_940401.qcf, then the second line of file "data_freq.in"
           should contain the number "8".

        To execute the check_QCF_comp program, issue the following command: 

        > check_QCF_comp <input_file_name>
