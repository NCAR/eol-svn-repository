steps:
0. edit/copy *.h for this model
   see the files in the model subdirs
   (I never got around to properly parameterizing this)
   You need the GD library to make the progs that create GIFs.
1. run mkease to make the ARCMIP EASE-Grid lat lon file
2. run findnn to make the nearest neighbor file relating
   the EASE-Grid to this model
3. printnn > ease_nn.txt will make a text output of the NN file
   ifnn is interactive findnn : give it "col row" e.g. "162 145"
   and it finds the NNs just like findnn
   perl -e 'while(<>){ /dist=(.*) km/ && print "$1\n";}' < ease_nn.txt > nn.dat
4. run mkdist to make netCDF file of NN distances
5. run nnmap to make GIFs of avg NN distances (foo.gif,bar.bif)
6. run regrid to cvt model to EASE-Grid, with distance-weighted
   interpolation using the NN file:
    nohup nice +20 \
     ../regrid /path/to/model/*may*nc /path/to/model/*mon*nc \
     >& regrid.err < /dev/null &
