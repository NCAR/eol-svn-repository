<h2>README file for NL EASE-Grid Geolocation tar file</h2>
<hr>
<p>The enclosing tar file contains ancillary data for data sets defined in
the NL (Northern Hemisphere, "low", i.e. 25 km resolution) EASE-Grid.  The
tar file includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>IDL (Interactive Data Language) program <a
href="easeconv.pro">easeconv.pro</a> and help file <a
href="easeconv_help.html">easeconv_help.html</a> (for dataset users with IDL): this program contains routines to convert between
latitude/longitude and row/column coordinates.

<li>C source code <a href="ezlhconv.c">ezlhconv.c</a> and header file
<a href="ezlhconv.h">ezlhconv.h</a> (for dataset users with knowledge
of C programming): subroutines in these files can be called from the
user's main program, to convert between latitude/longitude and
row/column coordinates.  

<li>FORTRAN source code <a href="ezlhconv.f">ezlhconv.f</a> (for
dataset users with knowledge of FORTRAN programming):  subroutines in
these files can be called from the user's main program, to convert
between latitude/longitude and row/column coordinates.

<li>For dataset users who only have need of the latitude and longitude of
the center of any cell in the grid, geolocation data files contain flat,
binary arrays of 4-byte integers containing the latitude or longitude of
the respective grid cell, in hundred-thousandth degrees.  The user
should divide the stored integer value by 100,000. to yield decimal
degrees, with 1 meter precision.  The user is expected to know which
byte-ordering convention is required by their system.  Files are provided
in both unix (a.k.a. "big-endian" or "MSB") and PC (a.k.a "little-endian"
or "LSB") byte orders.  The NL EASE-Grid has dimensions 721x721 pixels.</p>

File naming convention for geolocation files is:</p>

ggpppooo.GZ</p>

<ul>
<li>gg: grid name {NL, NH, SL, SH, ML, MH}
<li>ppp: parameter {LAT, LON}
<li>ooo: byte-order, {MSB, LSB}
<li>.GZ extension indicates the files are compressed using GNU gzip.
</ul>
</p>
Depending on the coverage area (this varies for different grids),
scaled latitudes range from -90.00000 to 90.00000, and scaled
longitudes range from -180.00000 to 180.00000, with missing data
(i.e. corners of grids with hemispheric coverage) indicated by scaled
value 14316.55765.</p>

<li><a href="N200correct.mpp">N200correct.mpp</a> (Northern Hemisphere map
projection parameters (.mpp) file) and the <a href="Nl.gpd">Nl.gpd</a>
(25-km grid parameter definition (.gpd) file): contain projection and grid
resolution information specifying a 25-km grid resolution, for the full
hemisphere, Lambert's equal-area projection.  This information is required
for users who want to use the generic software packages in NSIDC's <a
href="ftp://baikal.colorado.edu/pub/NSIDC/README">Scientific Programmer's
Software Library</a>.
