ARCMIP status

Grid definition:

The ARCMIP EASE-Grid is a 50km equal area grid on a
northern azimuthal projection, i.e. a 50km version of
the original NL/NH grids for SSM/I described at:

http://nsidc.org/data/ease/ease_grid.html

I call this "N5": a 50km grid for the entire hemisphere,
which is a 360x360 grid (129600 cells).
The ARCMIP 70x55 domain.txt grid boundaries plus a 5 cell
border was taken for the ARCMIP EASE-Grid.
Center of the grid is 72N 153W.
N5 columns 113 - 212 and rows 101 - 192.
(100x92 = 9200 cells)

I have a little picture of it (1st URL)
and a text file (2nd URL) which compares things to the
sample ARCMIP 70x55 domain.txt file (3rd URL).

In the picture (which is 360x360 pixels), the big square
is the CASPR data, the next square is the ARCMIP EASE-Grid
as I have defined it, and the smallest square is the
area on N5 which contains domain.txt (not the actual grid
from domain.txt, which would not be a square on this
map projection).

The latlons of the corners of the ARCMIP EASE-Grid are:

      where col  row  lat       lon
upper left  113  101  41.89710 -139.69868
upper right 212  101  50.81162  157.94894
lower left  113  192  58.93256  -79.84573
lower right 212  191  74.54461   69.44396

software development:
Completed s/w to re-grid model data in ARCSyM-style netCDF
to the ARCMIP 50km EASE-Grid. Test runs have been made
for 2 models (below).


received 4 models:
1. ARCSyM : converted to EASE-Grid, samples sent to John Cassano
2. HIRHAM (version 2): converted to EASE-Grid, samples being
evaluated by Annette Rinke
3. COAMPS : data structure is not as expected, waiting for new files
4. NARCM : data file corrupted, waiting for resubmittal


sample data:
Sample data files for ARCSyM and HIRHAM models are available
at a temporary ftp site:

open questions:
I still have some open questions. I have received very little
input on these issues in the past but cannot go any further
without resolution.

1. ARCMIP EASE-Grid
I need official confirmation on the size and location of
the ARCMIP EASE-Grid. The key question is how many EASE-Grid
cells should buffer the extent of domain.txt?

2. interpolation
On John Cassano's suggestion, I am using the 4 closest model
points in a linear distance-weighted average to determine the
value for each and every ARCMIP EASE-Grid cell. Thus there is
a significant edge effect, where the 4 closest model points
are 1700km away. The data in these EASE cells are pretty
much junk. (I can/will provide the model points and their
distances that I use for interpolation.)

3. ZSFC and land-sea mask
Rather than interpolate these values from domain.txt,
I think it makes more sense to get the real values from
a land use database.
I have asked before and received no response-
which database shall I use?
i.e. which database was used to create domain.txt?
