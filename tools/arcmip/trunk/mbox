Gents,  The ARCMIP effort is moving forward.  We are
requested to do some coordinate conversions from lat long
to this EASE grid.  AS you see below, info is forthcoming.
We will see what Mr. Fowler has to offer. cheers,
Jim M

Even as I sent the earlier message, this was waiting.  Please
look it over John and speak with John directly
if there are questions.  Thanks,  Jim
PS-We haven't received any offical ARCMIP datasets yetr
but there is a rumor that Judy Curry will have one to us within
days.

John,  FYI on ARCMIP.  It would be useful to
provide an update to Judy and what you have
been doing.  Can we discuss this after you read
this over?  When Will it be possible to have some
coordinate conversions completed os that Judy and others
can compare.    We can talk about it,

Thanks,  JIm

Here are a few updates on arcmip.  From what I am hearing most of the 
groups are making excellent progress towards completing their 
simulations and getting them ready for JOSS.

The CASPR and ISCCP satellite data sets are almost finished in terms 
of interpolating to ease grid, and comparison with sheba data is 
underway.  will keep  you posted on this.

The ARCMIP BAMS article is underway, hope to have a very rough draft 
out for comments fairly soon

Colin has raised a few issues of relevance to the whole group.

For the 1D output at sheba grid pint, for the advective tendencies 
save  only the adiabatic tendencies, vertical and horizontal 
tendencies separately.

For height of lowest cloud base, hugh morrison and matt shupe have 
been using 10^-5 g m-3 as a threshold value in comparison of model 
with cloud radar for sheba,  not terribly sensitive to the threshold 
value between 10^-3 and 10^-7 g m^-3.  For those models allowing 
fraction, this is less straightforward, because there are so many 
ways this can be handled incl overlap issues, etc.  Would be open to 
anything that anyone has to suggest here

Klaus reports that the new GLIMPSE homepage is at 
<http://www.awi-potsdam.de/www-pot/atmo/glimpse/index.html>http://www.awi-potsdam.de/www-pot/atmo/glimpse/index.html

As far as I know we are still on for the next ARCMIP workshop in in 
Potsdam on 2 and 3 June 2003, in conjunction with the GLIMPSE 
meeting.  Definitely gives us a deadline for getting things done!

Judy

Hi All,  This may be a great opportunity to get JOSS some
"free" experience with GIS tools.  I think it would
be highly desirable to be represented here, especially
if students are interested.  Please respond to Olga
ASAP with possibilities since seating is very limited.
Greg and I will be out at SBI mtg for the first offering
on 6-7 March.

Jim

Hi Judy,  Hope things are well with you and Peter in Georgia.
Until 5 days ago, I think there was more snow in Georgia than
on the Front Range of Colorado.  We've managed to get 6-8 inches
out at my house.

Just to update you on ARCMIP activities from our end.  We just received 
the first set of model data from John Cassano sending along ARCSyM
data.  We have done some homework on the EASE grid transforms and will 
start the conversion processing in the near future

I spoke to John at length about the data he is providing along with the
data that we might expect from other ARCMIP participants.  In the case 
of ARCSyM, the data are a 50 km resolution and John believes most others 
will be of similar spatial resolution.

 From your notes below, I understand that the CASPR/ISCCP satellite data 
are being converted to EASE at 25 km.  Now, back in Nov. you and I 
discussed this and the conclusion was that we should convert model 
output to EASE at 25 km.  However, John Cassano points out that going 
from 50 to 25 km for the model output really adds nothing to the 
dataset.  I just want to make sure about what resolution we want for the 
model output in EASE.  If we go with 25km resolution, do you recommend a 
preferred interpolation scheme to "fill" the data?

You should know that our plan is to coordinate our conversion work with 
the CASPR/ISCCP work being done by Math Rothstein at CU so that the 
generated model grids will overlay properly (e.g. model EASE grid point 
of origin and projection matches the  EASE grid for the CASPR data ). 
John Cassano will also help with this work.

I have CC'ed John C. and Math R. on this note in the hopes of reaching 
resolution that meets all requirements.  Guidance appreciated.

Have a good weekend,  Jim M

hi jim all this sounds great.  i'm not sure why the decision was made 
to do the satellite data at 25 km, personally i thought it should be 
50 km.  randy reeder is working on the caspr satellite data, pls 
coordinate with him also (i think he and mat are coordinating at 
least somewhat).  can't wait til that model output starts rolling in 
...

Hi Judy,  Since we have not started any processing, given
your comment below, and discussions with John C. and others,
  all ARCMIP model output will be converted to a 50 km EASE grid.

We will coordinate with Messrs. Rothstein and
Reeder to make everything is compatible.

Regards,  Jim

Hi Jim

I just spoke with Math. There is some concern about having the
model data at 50km and the validation data at 25km. My opinion
is that we are better off to keep the observational data at a
relatively high resolution, and each modeling group can interpolate
or average that data to coarser resolution if needed. Also, by
having the higher resolution observational data the modelers can
assess sub-grid scale variability.

With all of that said, Math made the point that he wasn't aware of
a 50km EASE grid. I thought the EASE grid could be used at any resolution,
and with us choosing a 50km grid it would be easily compatible with
the 25km grid he is using for the observational data. Could you provide
us with the details for the 50km EASE grid you plan on using? I think
it is essential that the 50km EASE grid points align with everyother
25km EASE grid point of the observational data.

I'd appreciate your thoughts on this. Since JOSS just got the first
model output and the interpolation hasn't begun yet it seems best to
settle these issues now.

Thanks,
John

john...

unfortunately, i cannot answer all of your questions...hopefully 
some of the others will respond...

i can, however, give you a description of the grid we're using for 
the observational data, and i think it's a good idea to collocate any 
50km grid you establish for model output with this...and this should 
be easy, since our grid is merely a subset of the northern hemispheric 
25km ease-grid described in the webpages you referenced...in fact, it 
is the inner-most 321x321 square...converting between our grid and the 
hemispheric is simply a matter of adding or subtracting 200 to the row 
and column...

hope that helps...i'm available for any questions...

-mathew 

ps...i'm just finishing up the documentation now and will be sending 
you the isccp product on 8mm tape...

Hi John,

I'll offer my $0.02 worth of thoughts on this, and hopefully help clear
up some of the confusion.

The infomation in the domain.txt file does correspond to a 50km resolution
polar stereographic map projection centered at 72N and 153W. From reading
the README file for CASPR ARCMIP data it seems to me that the CASPR
ARCMIP data has been subsampled from the original 25km resolution to
match the 50km ARCMIP domain resolution. I believe Randy Reeder was the
person that handled this conversion from the original AVHRR data to the
ARCMIP domain.

I believe we were planning on using a 50km grid size for the ARCMIP
model output. This grid would be a subset of points from a 50km northern
hemisphere EASE grid (similar to the N200 projection described above,
except it would be an N50 project).

The grid should be centered at 72N and 153W and should encompass the entire
standard ARCMIP model domain (see the blue outline in the attached JPEG
file). Obviously the orientation of this ARCMIP model domain, relative
to the northern hemisphere EASE grid will require a bigger EASE grid
domain than just 70x55 grid points. I think the important point is
that the new ARCMIP EASE grid encompasses all of the standard ARCMIP
model domain grid points (and probably a slight buffer region beyond
this standard model domain to account for differences in model domains
between the different ARCMIP modeling groups).

The other very important point about the 50km EASE grid for the ARCMIP
model output is that the points in this domain should correspond to every
other point on Math Rothstein's 25km EASE grid for the ISCCP satellite data.
I believe he will be in contact shortly with the EASE grid map projection
information for his domain.

This won't be an issue since you will be using a 50km EASE grid with
50km model output.

I hope this helps.

  Hi John,

    The CASPR data you have at JOSS was
 submitted by me in early December. The
 original data from which this subset was
 produced is the SHEBA AVHRR Full Arctic 25 km
 Retrievals produced using the Cloud and Surface Parameter
 Retrieval ( CASPR ) algorithms produced by Jeff Key
 and available at  stratus.ssec.wisc.edu/products .

    The data files submitted to JOSS ( caspr_arcmip_1997.tar.gz
 and caspr_arcmip_1998.tar.gz ) are subsets of the above data
 for the years 1997-1998 covering the 'ARCMIP region' as given
 in the domain.txt file. As such they have the resolution of
 the domain.txt file ( ~ 50 km ) and are not related to the
 EASE grid.

    I am in the process of producing new CASPR data files that
 do correspond to the `new' ARCMIP region using the EASE grid.
 I have programs to produce this data set assuming a 25 km
 resolution and a region defined by columns 200 -> 520 and
 rows 200 -> 520 in the Northern Hemisphere EASE coordinates.
 It appears now that I should wait until the final resolution
 and ARCMIP region are defined.

hi john...

it appears having everyone on a 50km grid is the desired goal...
i will reprocess the isccp data at this resolution and send it to 
you...the parameters are similar as the 25km grid i previously 
described and are as follows...

again it is a northern hemispheric ease grid, this time at 50km, making 
it a 361x361 square...it is "bore-centered" to the other ease grids (the 
12.5km and 25km described on nsidc's webpages)...i will be placing the 
isccp data (and randy the caspar data) on a subset of this grid starting 
at column 100, row 100 and which will comprise the inner-most 161x161 grid...

here is some c code i'll be using to conver from lat/lon to grid 
coordinates...i downloaded this code from nsidc's website and made 
just a few modifications (scale=0.5) to create the 50km grid...
remember to round the resulting grid coordinates up at .5 to get 
the integer row and column...

int ease_conv(double lat, double lon, double *r, double *s) {
   double Rg, phi, lam, rho, r0, s0, scale;
   int cols, rows;

   scale = 0.5;  /* 50km grid */

   cols = 721;
   rows = 721;

   /* radius of earth / nominal cell size */
   Rg = scale*6371.228/25.067525;

   r0 = (cols-1)/2. * scale;
   s0 = (rows-1)/2. * scale;

   /* degrees to radians */
   phi = lat*3.14159/180.0;
   lam = lon*3.14159/180.0;

   rho = 2 * Rg * sin(3.14159/4. - phi/2.);
   *r = r0 + rho * sin(lam);
   *s = s0 + rho * cos(lam);

   return(0);
 }


hope that helps...mathew

Subject: arcmip ease-grid questions
Status: RO

Hi all, I'm (finally) back working on the ARCMIP regridding
to the EASE-Grid. Sorry for the delay, but it is now my top
priority and I hope to finish soon. Although we have just 2
sets of model data here at JOSS (plus the CASPR and ISSCP
data which is now available for ordering).
There are a couple of open issues left over from our last
round of discussion, most importantly interpolation.

1. What should I do when more than one model point
falls into an EASE-Grid cell. For example, there are
327 EASE-Grid cells that contain 2 points from the
domain.txt file. (325 in the ARCSyM domain.nc)
Shall I average, some sort of weighted average,
take the point closest to center of the EASE-Grid cell, ... ?

2. fyi 37 of these duplicate cells have conflicting land uses.
If you would like to resolve this and produce a new domain.txt for
the EASE-Grid, somebody point me to a land use database and
conflict-resolution algorithm. I can then generate from the
EASE-Grid latlons directly.

3. fyi
I have put the EASE-Grid version of domain.txt on the web
for you to browse:

http://www.joss.ucar.edu/~john/tmp/ease_domain.txt

r=column, s=row for the EASE-Grid NL at 50km.
elat,elon are the centers of those grid cells.
Look at the bottom of the file to see some little stats,
incl the duplicates for land use clashes.

4. For the model data, I will leave "empty" cells in the new grid
as some sort of missing value, whatever the model already uses.

5. The EASE-Grid for domain.txt is 90x82. How much of a buffer
around this do you want (#cells, km, or degrees latlon) to
accomodate different models' edges? The latlons of the centers
of the corner cells are:
upper left   45.352936, -140.042451
upper right  53.890356,  159.954751
lower left   61.578634,  -83.558400
lower right  77.398961,   75.465545

6. Finally, fyi, a simple gif showing the grid bounds:
