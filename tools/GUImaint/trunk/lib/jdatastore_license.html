<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deployment Licenses are granted subject to certain limitations and usage parameters specific to the type of Deployment License you have acquired from Borland.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you would like to install and/or deploy a greater number of copies of the Product than the number of Deployment Licenses you have acquired from Borland or if you would like to alter the type or usage parameters of any Deployment License you have acquired from Borland, you must first contact Borland to obtain written approval and pricing for any such modifications to your license.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Borland.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.4&#9;Competitive Product Restrictions. </B>You may not include the Product or any component thereof, including any Redistributables (as defined in Section 3) in any general-purpose software development tool, library, component, or any other product that is generally competitive with or a substitute for the Product or any other Borland product offerings; nor may you use the Product to create a product or operate a service that is generally competitive with the Product or any other Borland product offerings, including any general-purpose software development tool.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.1&#9;Redistributables.  </B>The Product may include certain files, libraries and/or source code specifically designated as &quot;redistributables&quot; by Borland in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary to use Works created using the Product (&quot;Redistributables&quot;).  From time to time, Borland may designate other files as Redistributables.  You should refer to the documentation, including any "readme" or "deploy" files provided with the Product, for additional information regarding Redistributables. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may freely redistribute source code or compiled code that is entirely your own and does not contain any Redistributables. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.2&#9;Licensing of Redistributables.</B>  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License including the restrictions of Section 3.3, Borland grants you the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited license to: (a) make exact copies of the Redistributables and distribute those copies solely as components of your Works and solely as required for permitting end users of the Works (&quot;End Users&quot;) to install and execute the Works; (b) install and execute Redistributables, without modification, on computers that you own or possess solely for your own internal use; and (c) sublicense to your End Users the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to install and execute Redistributables, without modification, solely as components of Works and solely for such End Users’ own internal use, subject to End Users’ compliance with the restrictions in Section 5 as to Redistributables.  The rights granted to you under this Section 3.2 may not be exercised by others, including co-developers, regardless of how you might compile, link, or package your Works.  These rights apply only to Redistributables and to no other file, library, source code or other component or derivative work of the Product.  They may be exercised only with respect to Works created by you using a duly licensed, properly registered copy of the Product.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.3&#9;Certain Restrictions.</B>  Regardless of any modifications that you make and regardless of how you might compile, link, or package your Works:  (a) you may not permit your End Users to modify or further distribute Redistributables or use Redistributables in any program that they create; (b) you may not use Borland's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market your Works, except to state descriptively that your Work was written using the Product; (c) you may not incorporate or distribute a Redistributable with a Work or other program that is capable of functioning as a general purpose development tool, library, or component, or is otherwise generally competitive with or a substitute for the Product or the Redistributable itself; (d) all copies of the Works you create must bear a valid copyright notice, either your own or the Borland copyright notice that appears on the Product, and you may not remove or alter any Borland copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of the Redistributables; and (e) you may only distribute Redistributables with Works that add primary and substantial functionality to the Redistributables and are not merely a set or subset of any of the Redistributables, and that are created in accordance with the terms of this License.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.4&#9;Relationship with End Users.  </B>Except as set forth in Section 4, there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.  Consequently, Borland provides no warranty at all to any person, other than the limited warranty provided to you the original purchaser of the Product, as set forth herein, and you will be solely responsible to your End Users (or anyone else who uses or acquires Works) for support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance (including with respect to any Redistributables included therein), and such persons will have no right to contact Borland for any services or assistance.  You will indemnify, defend and hold Borland, its licensors, its suppliers and each of their respective employees, officers, directors and affiliates, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of or related to the use, procurement, reproduction or distribution of your Works by third parties.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.5&#9;Third Party Software.</B>  The Product, including Redistributables, may include source code, redistributable files, and/or other files provided by a third party vendor (&quot;Third Party Product&quot;).  Since use of Third Party Product might be subject to license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor, you should refer to the on-line documentation (if any) provided with Third Party Product for any license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor.  In any event, any license restrictions imposed by a third party vendor are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions of this License.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.6&#9;Other Rights.  </B>Contact Borland for the applicable royalties due and other licensing terms for all other uses or distribution of the Redistributables.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following terms and conditions (&quot;Special Terms&quot;) are specific to certain editions and components of the Product and are in addition to the provisions of Sections 2 and 3.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.1&#9;ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO EVALUATION SOFTWARE</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may exercise your rights under this license to use the Product and to create Works for the sole purpose of evaluating or demonstrating the Product.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Product contains certain time-out features designed to prevent the Product from being deployed in a runtime environment for longer than a specified period without Deployment License keys.  Deployment License keys will be provided to you at such time as you purchase the requisite Deployment Licenses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THE PRODUCT ALSO CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD.  WORKS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE WORKS MAY NO LONGER RUN.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.&#9;SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES.</B>  Borland is not required under this License to provide any installation, training or other services to you.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8.&#9;Registration.</B>  You must register the Product with Borland as a condition to your rights to use the Product.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9.&#9;Confidentiality.  </B>The Product (including its underlying source code) and the terms of this License contain confidential information of Borland.  You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person (other than your employees and individual contractors who use the Product and who have agreed to keep confidential any of Borland’s confidential information that you provide to them), and not use it for any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License.  These restrictions do not apply to any information which is or becomes (through no fault of yours) publicly available.  If you are required by law or order of a court or other government authority to disclose Borland’s confidential information, then you will immediately notify Borland as soon as possible, but in any event prior to the disclosure, and will cooperate with Borland, at its expense and request, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</B>  <B>IN NO EVENT WILL BORLAND BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF BORLAND KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  BORLAND’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.&#9;THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.</B>  Borland will defend and settle any suit brought against you by a third party (not your affiliate) based on a claim that the Product infringes upon any U.S. copyright and Borland will pay those costs and damages finally awarded against you in such suit that are specifically attributable to such claims or those amounts payable by you under a settlement of such suit. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on you:  (a) notifying Borland promptly in writing of such action; (b) giving Borland sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at Borland’s request and expense, assisting in such defense. If the Product becomes, or in Borland’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim that Borland is required to defend, then Borland may (at its option and expense) either:  (a) procure for you the right to continue using the Product; (b) replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing; or (c) terminate this License and your rights hereunder to use the Product and refund a pro rata portion of any license fee you paid under this License, based on a three (3) year product life.

You will indemnify Borland against all liability, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from or related to an Excluded Claim. <B>This section 11 states Borland’s entire liability and your sole and exclusive remedy for third-party claims relating to the Product.</P>

You will provide reasonable assistance to Borland in connection with this provision.  You agree to pay the cost of the audit if any underpayments during the period covered by the audit amount to more than five percent (5%) of the fees actually owed for that period.</P>
