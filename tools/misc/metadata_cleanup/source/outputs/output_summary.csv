ACADIS,106.230,Search Coil Magnetometer Array Data on Svalbard,"Two-axis search coil magnetometers sample the horizontal components of Earths magnetic field at four sites on Svalbard. Norway at a rate of 10 s/sec. These data record ultra-low-frequency (ULF) oscillations in the Earth's space environment that are generated as a result of interactions and instabilities in the plasmas in the overhead ionosphere and magnetosphere. 
Note: Data have been added as of 19 December 2011."
ACADIS,106.335,Water temperature and bathymetric depth soundings for lakes on the North Slope of Alaska,"A regional assessment of thermokarst lakes across the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska was conducted using satellite images to detect changes in lake coverage and morphometry during the satellite era. This effort was supplemented by the use of digital aerial photographs to extend the analysis back to ~1950, and to assess temporal patterns of change. The analyses were augmented by summer field studies focused on lake evaporation, seasonal and interannual changes in fundamental lake characteristics, and collection of lake water temperature and bathymetry in three study areas. The measurement program is designed to map patterns of shoreline changes, monitor interannual variations in lake levels, and estimate energy and moisture exchange between lakes and the atmosphere. In summer 2008, lakes near Barrow were studied and instrumented. In 2009, the focus was on lakes further inland near Atqasuk. In 2010, lakes near the Arctic Coastal Plain-Arctic Foothills were studied."
ACADIS,106.336,Ecosystem metabolism for an arctic warm spring-stream,"This dataset investigated the productivity of a perennial, Arctic spring-stream. Ivishak Spring has the stable discharge (~131 L/s) and temperature (~4-8 deg C) typical for springs. It is unusual, however, in having an annual cycle of daylight from 24 hrs/d (summer) to 0 hrs/d (winter). It tested the hypothesis that stored detritus would buffer carbon limitation during winter when gross primary production (GPP) is minimized, resulting in constant rates of community respiration (CR) year-round due to constant temperatures. It used open-channel methods to measure GPP and CR monthly from March 2007 to August 2009. Mean annual GPP was 458 gC/m2. Such a level is typical for temperate desert-streams but was surprising for an Arctic stream. Annual CR (887 gC/m2) was also remarkable. The high metabolism of this stream is explained by an open canopy, moderate year-round temperatures, stable bed, and high bryophyte biomass (48 gAFDM/m2). Strong seasonal cycles of GPP were mirrored by CR (r=0.65) indicating the possibility of carbon limitation during winter. This result falsified our hypothesis that CR would be relatively stable year-round due to a detritus buffer and constant temperature 
The data are in tab delimited, and Excel spreadsheet files.

Note: these data are in process, with updates possible."
ACADIS,102.253,Satellite-derived polynya areas in the northern Bering Sea,Satellite-derived Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS (AMSR-E) sea ice concentrations are utilized to calculate polynya areas in the northern Bering Sea (January-April from 2003 to 2008). Three polynya regions are presented: (a) Anadyr Gulf Polynya; (b) St. Lawrence Island Polynya; and (c) Cape Romanzo Polynya. Data are in Excel (.xls) and comma delimited (.csv) format.

Discrete downwelling PAR irradiance profiles are presented from 96 sites measured with a PUV-510 instrument (Biospherical Instruments). PAR irradiance is in units of uE/cm2/sec and depths is in units of meters. Data are in Excel (.xls) and comma delimited (.csv) format.
ACADIS,106.337,Total and tall shrub cover on the North Slope of Alaska,"To monitor changes in shrub cover, aid field studies, and inform ecosystem models, shrub cover was mapped across the North Slope of Alaska. This data set consists of maps of total and tall (1m height) shrub cover on the North Slope of Alaska, expressed in percent ground cover and at 30 m ground resolution. Images from IKONOS and SPOT satellite sensors detected tall and short shrub presences at high resolution (5 m grid cells). These were then used to train a Random Forest regression algorithm to map total and tall shrub cover, expressed as a percent of the total surface area, at 30 m resolution from a mosaic of Landsat scenes. The final shrub cover maps correspond well with field measurements (r 2 = 0.7, root mean square error = 17%, N = 24) and compared well with the existing vegetation type maps of the study area and a gridded temperature data set not used in the map generation. 
Details are given in: Beck, P. S. A., N. Horning, S. J. Goetz, M. M. Loranty, and K. Tape (2011), Shrub cover on the North Slope of Alaska: a circa 2000 baseline map, Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, 43(3), 355-363, doi: 10.1657/1938-4246-43.3.355.

ACADIS,106.334,Albedo of ice types in northeast Greenland's ablation zone,"Ice types, albedos and impurity content are characterized for the ablation zone of the Greenland ice sheet in Kronprinz Christians Land (808 N, 248 W). Along this ice margin the width of the ablation zone is only about 8 km. The emergence and melting of old ice in the ablation zone creates a surface layer of dust that was originally deposited with snowfall high on the ice sheet. This debris cover is augmented by locally derived wind-blown sediment. Subsequently, the surface dust particles often aggregate together to form centimetre-scale clumps that melt into the ice, creating cryoconite holes. The debris in the cryoconite holes becomes hidden from sunlight, raising the area-averaged albedo relative to surfaces with uniform debris cover. Spectral and broadband albedos were obtained for snow, ice hummocks, debris-covered ice, cryoconite-studded ice and barren tundra surfaces. Broadband ice albedos varied from 0.2 (for ice with heavy loading of uniform debris) to 0.6 (for ice hummocks with cryoconite holes). The cryoconite material itself has albedo 0.1 when wet."
ACADIS,106.340,"Arctic snow black carbon concentrations, and absorption by other light-absorbing aerosol","These data give estimates of black carbon (BC) mixing ratios from samples of snow or melting sea ice gathered by ourselves or by volunteers, mostly from 2006 to 2009 but with some data from earlier years. Almost all samples were collected in the spring season (March to early May) when the combination of snow cover and exposure to sunlight is maximized, and before the snow had started to melt. In many locations (Canadian Arctic, Russia, Greenland, Troms and Ny lesund) samples were gathered at intervals throughout the snowpack depth, giving information on the seasonal evolution of BC concentrations as the snow accumulated (and/or sublimated) throughout the winter. In addition to estimated BC mixing ratios, we give maximum possible BC concentration, the absorption Angstrom exponent of all light-absorbing aerosol in the snow, and the fraction of spectrally-integrated, solar-spectrum-weighted absorption by non-BC absorbers."

ACADIS,106.345,Sea Ice Experiment: Dynamic Nature of the Arctic (SEDNA),"The Sea Ice Experiment - Dynamic Nature of the Arctic (SEDNA) is an international collaborative effort to improve the understanding of the interaction between sea ice dynamics and Arctic climate. The SEDNA data portal provides access to 37 entries, from remote sensing to in situ measurements, collected during the ice camp in March and April 2007. 
Data are generally available in three formats: the original format, NetCDF, and ASCII. The original version is not always well documented. The NetCDF version includes carefully collected documentation placed in the header fields of the NetCDF file. Often, data are also available in a separate ASCII file as columns of data concatenated behind the NetCDF header information in plain text form. 
To access the data collected from SEDNA, please use the SEDNA data portal download link below."
ACADIS,106.346,Alaskan Lake Database Mapped from Landsat Images," The lake map for the State of Alaska was generated from selected Landsat acquired during summer seasons of circa 2000. Nearly 400 30-m resolution Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were used to produce the lake map. The database contains over 38,000 lakes larger than 0.1 km2. The spatial coverage of the product is nearly the entire state except the Aleutian islands. The lake product is released at three different levels in response to lake size classes: 
 
  Level 1: large lakes greater than 10 km2; 
  Level 2: medium-sized lakes between 1 and 10 km2; 
  Level 3: small lakes between 0.1 and 1 km2. 
 
 The Alaskan lake products are released in ArcView shapefile format."
ACADIS,106.347,Landsat Derived Historical Lake Extents,"Lake extent maps for the Alaska North Slope and Barrow peninsula were generated from selected Landsat satellite images between 1977 and 2008 available at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) database. The acquisition dates for the images are included in the individual filenames. The lake maps cover 400,000 km2 from 69.6dd N to 71.3dd N and -162.6dd W to -174.1dd W. 
The spatial resolution of the lake maps depends on the resolution of the Landsat image on which it was based. Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) based maps have a resolution of 60 x 60 meters. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) maps have 30 x 30 meter resolution. 
Lake extent maps are released in ArcView shapefile format. All files are projected in the UTM Zone 4 North with units of meters (m)."
ACADIS,106.348,Near-shore Topography Transects of Barrow area Lakes,"Near-shore topography transects perpendicular to the lake shore were conducted using a Sokkia C310 Automatic Level and survey rod. Survey transects logged location, elevation, and surface condition (e.g., vegetation, snow/ice, or water) at approximately three meter intervals. The transect also measured bathymetry along the transect for several meters into the lake where possible. Survey stations were logged in space by Trimble 5700 GPS receiver with a Zephyr Geodetic antenna. The horizontal accuracy of the Differential GPS (DGPS) point, based on the DGPS point processing reports, was approximately 20 cm. Although vertical accuracy was roughly 200 cm for the DGPS tie point, the accuracy of the transect points relative to each other was ~1cm. 
Most lakes in the area are unnamed so for this study, the lakes were named L and then a number counting up from 100 for lakes mapped in 2008, 200 for lakes mapped in 2009, and 300 for lakes mapped in 2010. 
This dataset is in ArcView shapefile format, and is projected in the UTM Zone 4 North with units of meters (m)."
ACADIS,106.349,Lake Water Level and Temperature from Pressure Sensors," Water level and temperature measurements were collected hourly in June through August for the years 2008 through 2010 several lakes near Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska. Solinst Levelogger Jr. water level and temperature sensors were used. Water level measurements were compensated for changes in barometric pressure using a Solinst Barologger Gold which was installed on the land surface near the lakes. Loggers were attached to a cable which had an anchor (sandbag) and float. Rafting lake ice moved sensors for the first weeks of each season until complete ice melt-out (generally in late June to early July). Data from the ice rafting periods has been removed from each sensor record.

ACADIS,106.370,Meteorology measurements during OASIS Barrow field intensive Spring 2009,"A measurement intensive campaign was carried out in Barrow, Alaska in spring 2009 as part of the Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Snowpack (OASIS) program. This dataset contains three-dimensional wind velocities measured at 2 heights (~ 2 m agl and 6 m agl) using sonic anemometers (Applied Technologies, Sonic Anemometer/Thermometer model (SATI/3K)). Also, from the measured speed of sound, virtual potential temperature was also obtained. 
Wind velocities and virtual potential temperature were acquired at 10 Hz. Meteorological variables such as wind speed and direction were obtained from vector-averaging the horizontal wind velocities over 1 minute intervals. Turbulent fluxes, such as friction velocities and sensible heat flux, were obtained from covariances of wind velocities and temperature over 15 minute averages. The longer time scale allows for adequate sampling of larger atmospheric eddies that contribute to the measured flux. Wind speeds and direction are accurate to +/- 0.03 m/s and +/- 0.1 degrees, respectively, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Turbulent fluxes are estimated to be accurate to +/- 10-15% due to statistical sampling issues."
ACADIS,106.371,Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) Photosynthesis-Irradiance Experiments,"The objective of the Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) project is to examine how physical changes affect biological processes within the flaw lead. The CFL system is formed when the central pack ice (which is mobile) moves away from coastal fast ice, opening a flaw lead. The CFL forms in the fall and continues as thin ice or open water throughout the winter. The flaw lead is circumpolar, with recurrent and interconnected polynyas occurring throughout the Arctic. The overarching objectives of the CFL project were to contrast the physical and biological systems of the flaw lead open water and thin ice to the adjacent landfast ice cover. The system will be studied throughout its yearly cycle, to determine the effects of global warming.

ACADIS,106.427,Adaptive long-term fasting in land and ice-bound polar bears: Data Table,"The data sets in the data table have been collected as part of a project to understand how reduced sea ice cover in the Arctic will impact polar bear populations. Bears that stay ashore in summer have almost no access to food and tend to be inactive. Those that stay on the ice, however, have continued access to prey and make extensive movements. Over a three year period, scientists from the University of Wyoming and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) followed the movements of bears in both habitats and monitored their body temperature, muscle condition, blood chemistry, and metabolism. The physiological data will be added to spatially-explicit individual-based population models to predict population response to reduced ice cover."

ACADIS,106.438,History of the Arctic Flora in North America,"This dataset in an attempt to increase understanding of how climate cycles of the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years) impacted divergence in Arctic and alpine tundra flora. Specimens were collected in Beringia and the mountains of western North America, focusing on populations existing within (western and eastern Beringia, and the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains, respectively), as well as sites between those refugia. Briefly, DNA was sequenced from chloroplast and nuclear loci for multiple species of tundra plants that inhabited the entire study region. Target species (Campanula species, Kobresia myosuroides, Lloydia serotina, Pinguicula vulgaris, Poa alpina, Rhodiola species, and Saxifraga species) were phylogenetically diverse and displayed a range of dispersal abilities, making them excellent candidates for evaluating general history of the tundra. Those genetic data make up this Arctic Flora dataset. From the genetic sequence data, gene trees are being reconstructed and used to estimate the patterns and timing of divergence, test which geologic and climatic events most impacted divergence, and infer how the process of genetic divergence differed between Arctic and alpine tundra refugia.



The data is archived in nexus files - the standard format for aligned sequence data ready to be used in a phylogenetic analysis. The files are separated by taxon and genetic locus within a given taxon. The nexus format provides details on the data type (DNA), number of samples, and length of sequence. Within a file, all the sequences are aligned but not interleaved, such that the 'sample name' is followed by the entire sequence for that sample. All the specimens that were collected are archived and publicly accessible in the Western Washington University Herbarium."

ACADIS,106.448,"Understanding Climate-Driven Phenological Change - Observations, Adaptations and Cultural Implications in Northeastern Siberia and Labrador/Nunatsiavut (PHENARC)","An important focus of the PHENARC project has been on qualitative climatic data from Labrador/Nunatsiavut. For this location, instrumental and qualitative meterological observations began in August 1771, when the Unitas Fratrum or Unity of the Brethren, established its first mission among the Inuit on the Labrador coast. The Moravian Brethren, as they are more commonly known, comprise a Christian church that has pre-reformation origins that go back to the Bohemian reformer Jan Hus (c. 1375-1415). Matthus Stach (1711-1787) was the pioneer of the Moravian Greenland missionaries, and it was he who advocated missionary work among the Inuit of the Labrador coast. 
The data cover all the missionary stations in Labrador; Nain, Okak, Hopedale, Hebron, Ramah and Makkovik. The station with the greatest data coverage is Nain. The observations of the missionaries lasted until 1939 when they were taken over by the Canadian Meteorological Service. After World War II, the missionaries lost their ties with the Inuit population and their missionary stations were regrouped. The last missionary left Nain in 2005. However, the Moravian church is still strong in many parts of Labrador. These documentary sources form a veritable goldmine and are discussed in the papers contained in this data set."

The unusual hydrology of this system relative to most other lakes studied for paleoclimate in this region provides a novel insight into different seasonal aspects of Alaskan paleoclimatology.

ARCSS,106.ARCSS069,Into the Arctic -- Information and Educational Activities for Studying Climate,"'Into the Arctic' contains educational materials about climate and climate history in the Arctic that use real data and questions from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2). It is in the form of a single zip file which can be expanded and the files burned to a CD. 
Beginning in 1993, scientists from all over the world participated in the GISP2 project to drill through 3,000 meters of ice in Greenland, and discovered a history of the world's climate. Inspired by the research results from GISP2, 'Into the Arctic' offers instructional materials and activities for teachers to use in the many contexts of their daily teaching routines. Its unique feature is that it provides data collected and used by research scientists, and it provides students with the questions scientists grapple with in their research. There are no right or wrong answers. Students are presented with the data, and they are free to suggest answers to the questions posed. Lessons and activities are designed for use by secondary through lower-level college students studying Earth science, geography, history, social studies or chemistry. 
Information and activities are divided into four sections: Climate, Climate Change, El Nino, and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2. The subjects selected range from the broad (Climate and Climate Change) to the more specific (El Nino and the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2) to provide the reader with background in Earth science that can then be applied using broadly related case studies."

Most of these gauges represent unique Arctic Ocean drainage basins in Northern Eurasia which are important to evaluate river input to Arctic Ocean. Drainage area of these unique basins are from 48 km2 to 2950000 km2 and they cover about 1074700 km2 or (82%) of Eurasian Arctic drainage basin. The data for Russia were collected at State Hydrological Institute, Saint Petersburg, Russia and data for Norway were provided by Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate. The data set covers a period from 1907 to 2003 with most data falling in the range from the mid-1930s to the mid-1990s."
ARCSS,106.232,Synthesis and Scaling of Hydrologic and Biogeochemical Data on the North Slope and Coastal Zone of Alaska,"Understanding land-ocean-atmosphere coupling is essential for developing an integrated view of the arctic system, and is a key component of the Study of the Northern Alaska Coastal System (SNACS) program. As an important contribution to SNACS, this data set contributes to an investigation of the linkage between hydrologic variables and constituent (nutrients and organic matter) fluxes. The overarching goal of the project of which this work is a part, is to develop a generalized understanding of discharge-constituent relationships in arctic basins. For this data set, water chemistry data were collected between May and August from sites on the Kuparuk, Sagavanirktok, and Colville rivers during 2006 and 2007."
ARCSS,106.ARCSS140,Cloud-Radiation Feedback: Boundary Layer Cloud Microphysical Properties and Processes,"This data set includes Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) cloud microphysical data collected onboard the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) C-130 aircraft. This work focused on improving the quality of algorithms used to process in situ measurements collected during First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) Regional Experiment, Arctic Cloud Experiment (SHEBA/FIRE, ACE) and applying the results to the analysis of five case studies. Such research was deemed valuable as a result of weaknesses and inconsistencies in the existing C-130 data set that were pointed out in a SHEBA workshop held in 2000. Data has been reprocessed by SPEC, Inc. to improve quality and add value to the measurements. Investigators selected five research days that were considered to be high priority by the SHEBA science team: 4 May, 8 July, 18 July, 28 July, and 29 July of 1998.

The water temperature data was combined with river discharge data to estimate energy flux for all basins and over the Russian pan-Arctic as a whole.
ARCSS,106.ARCSS138,Global Snow-Water-Equivalent Depth Coefficient-of-Variation Classification,"This data set provides a global distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories and a coefficient of variation applicable to each category, as the result of the Subgrid SNOW Distribution (SSNOWD) submodel that defines subgrid snow-depth and snow-cover variability. This data set provides the distribution of those nine categories and their coefficient-of-variation values on a global, 2.5 arc-min latitude-longitude (approximately 5-km) grid. The time period covered is 1 January 1994 through 1 January 2004. The SSNOWD submodel was formulated to improve the depiction of autumn through spring land-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks within global weather, climate, and hydrologic models. From both atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives, the subgrid snow-depth distribution is an important quantity to account for within large-scale models. In the natural system, these subgrid snow-depth distributions are largely responsible for the mosaic of snow-covered and snow-free areas that develop as the snow melts, and the impacts of these fractional areas must be quantified in order to realistically simulate grid-averaged surface fluxes. SSNOWD's formulation incorporates observational studies showing that snow distributions can be described by a lognormal distribution and the snow-depth coefficient-of-variation (CV). Using an understanding of the physical processes that lead to these observed snow-depth variations, a global distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories was developed, and coefficient-of-variation values were assigned to each category based on published measurements. Data are in binary format."

This global climatology is the combination of NODC's 1998 world climatology (WOA), the Environmental Working Group (EWG) Arctic Ocean Atlas (AOA), and select Canadian data provided by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO). While the NODC data includes the Arctic ocean, the AOA data provides a better description of this region. Neither of these data fields provides a good representation of the Canadian Archipelago region and nearby bays in the winter months. The data from the Bedford Institute of Oceanography allowed us to bridge this data hole. These three data sets were merged using an optimal interpolation routine such that our PHC retains the high quality world description provided by the WOA while improving the Arctic with the AOA fields and Canadian data. 
In summary, Polar Science Center Hydrographic Climatology (PHC) = WOA (Levitus) '98 everywhere except in our arctic domain, where we have blended in the AOA field (from EWG), and the BIO data to produce a more realistic arctic region."

ARCSS,106.ARCSS030,Model Output from the Arctic Region Climate System Model (ARCSyM),"The Arctic Region Climate System Model (ARCSyM) provides output data to study ocean-ice-atmosphere and land-atmosphere interactions at high latitudes, at horizontal resolutions ranging from seven kilometers to 100 kilometers. Model data specifically cover Alaska, the Arctic Basin, and Antarctica. 
The ARCSyM model was first developed from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Regional Climate Model (RegCM2) (Giorgi et al 1993). It was adapted for the Arctic by the addition of coupled sea ice and mixed layer ocean models, ice phase moisture physics, and a new longwave radiative transfer scheme. In the arctic version, the original Land Surface Model (LSM) was replaced by the NCAR LSM and new arctic vegetation types were introduced. 
The model can be initialized and forced at the lateral boundaries by observational analyses or General Climate Model (GCM) output and develops its own climate within the specified model domain. Lateral boundary conditions include temperature, wind, moisture, sea level pressure and pressure heights."

ARCSS,106.ARCSS045,Global Seasonal Snow Classification System,"The data file defines a global seasonal snow classification system. Based on the physical properties of the snow (depth, density, thermal conductivity, number of layers, degree of wetting, etc.), the world's seasonal snow covers were divided into six classes, plus classes for water and ice fields. Each class was defined by its physical properties, then empirically related to climate using three variables (precipitation, wind, and air temperature). A vegetation proxy was used for wind data: tall vegetation equals low wind, short vegetation equals high wind. 
The snow classification data are formatted into an array of integers, each value representing a 0.5-degree latitude by 0.5-degree longitude cell. The data set was developed and tested for the Northern Hemisphere. Results for the Southern Hemisphere are untested and have not been evaluated. The Southern Hemisphere suffers from a reduced density of meteorological data which may well have influenced the quality of the snow classification in that area. Also note that much of Antarctica is inappropriately defined as water (the vegetation data set did not extend that far south). A 0.5- x 0.5-degree land-sea mask could be used to set the Antarctica region to the ice classification if this region is of interest. 
National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) has created a land/ocean mask from the original (updated) Global Ecosystem map (see Related links) used in the derivation of the snow classification. The mask may be used to set the land mass of Antarctica to ice, as described above, altering the data set as submitted."

The first two simulations are for acidic tussock tundra in the Toolik Lake region of the Kuparuk River watershed for the years 1921 to 2144. Each of these simulations is made up of two parts. The first part is based upon a reconstruction of historical climate variables from 1921 to 1995, while the second part is based upon a doubling of C02 and the concurrent changes in temperature, soil moisture, and irradiance from 1996 to 2144. The historical period is the same for both simulations. The future period differs between the two simulations: One simulation assumes a direct relationship between soil moisture and temperature (i.e., warmer and wetter), and the other assumes an inverse relationship between soil moisture and temperature (i.e., warmer and drier). The climate drivers used for the simulations are included as part of this dataset. The second two simulations are for acidic tussock tundra throughout the entire Kuparuk River basin for 1995 only. The first simulation uses the reconstructed 1995 climate. The second simulation uses the same climate with an increase in soil moisture.

Data were collected between 1882-1994, but the time period covered by each station and the parameters measured are variable. Daily measurements of snow depth were taken from three snow measuring rods placed in a meteorological enclosure. In individual cases, when the meteorological enclosure was unrepresentative of the surroundings in respect to snow cover formation, the snow measuring rods were placed near the station on a specially selected plot. The daily mean was calculated by averaging the readings from the three rods, rounded to the nearest whole centimeter. If the average was less than 0.5 cm, the mean was considered zero, and if it was greater than or equal to 0.5 cm, it was considered 1 cm. If snow, ice, or melt water was absent at one of the rods, the mean depth was calculated by dividing the sum of the readings by three. The daily data were then averaged at the end of a ten-day period into a single value. This averaging was done three times per month, with the final period in the month containing from eight to 11 days of data, depending on the month.

ARCSS,106.266,Late Holocene Climatic and Environmental Change Inferred from Arctic Lake Sediments,"This Dataset consists of data which accompanies fourteen papers in a special issue of the Journal of Paleolimnology. These papers report new records of Holocene climate and environmental change from Arctic lakes, with emphasis on the last 2000 years. The study sites span the high latitudes of North America and extend into northwestern Europe. The studies rely on multiple proxy indicators to reconstruct past climate, including: varve thicknesses, chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, biogenic-silica and organic-matter content, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms, and the frequency of lake-ice-rafted aggregates. These proxies primarily document changes in past summer temperatures, the main control on physical and biological processes in lakes at high latitudes. The records will be integrated into a larger network of paleoclimate sites to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of climate change and to compare the paleoclimate inferences with the output of general circulation models. The project of which these data are a part contributes to understanding the Arctic system by placing 20th century climatic change into a longer-term context of inter-decadal climatic variability spanning the last 2000 years."

Thawing during the summer months caused the development of a thawed layer at the top with the thaw depth again decreasing during freeze-up of the thawed layer in fall. Frozen ground depth on the other hand is calculated with soil temperatures at all depths above-freezing at the beginning.

Vertical profiles of hydrographic, fluorescence, and nutrients over the upper 150 m were obtained using a Sea-Bird SBE-19 CTD (serial number 1923347-2995) combined with a Wetstar model WS3S miniature flow-through fluorometer (serial number 646P), which had an excitation wavelength of 460 nm and an emission wavelength of 695 nm. The continuous CTD profiles were processed using standard SeaSoft software with the results being binned into 0.5 m depth intervals. The fluorometer was calibrated in the laboratory with aqueous solutions of resorufin (Christensen, 2006a). The fluorescence of resorufin was compared with the fluorescence of purified chlorophyll-a (from the algae Anacystis nidulans) dissolved in buffered acetone (10 ml of 1% (weight per volume) magnesium carbonate per L of 90% acetone). These chlorophyll solutions showed a fluorescence of 40.0 times that of resorufin for the same molar concentrations. The output of the fluorometer was first converted to fluorescence of resorufin (mmol/L) and then to that of chlorophyll-a (expressed in microgram-chl/L) using this factor and the molecular weight of chlorophyll-a (893.5 g/mole)."

Data cover the period 1 January 1979 to 31 August 2002. Data were obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Data Support Section, dataset ds117.0 (). Two meter temperatures are archived as 6 hour mean values. Daily means were computed from these values. Data were regridded from the native N80 (roughly 1 degree resolution) reduced Gaussian grid to the Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) 25km grid using a bilinear interpolation scheme. This scheme is described in ECMWF [2003]. The ERA-40 system assimilates available surface temperature observations.

Thawing during the summer months caused the development of a thawed layer at the top with the thaw depth again decreasing during freeze-up of the thawed layer in fall. Frozen ground depth on the other hand is calculated with soil temperatures at all depths above-freezing at the beginning. Here the frozen depth increased during winter, and spring thawing eventually decreases its value.

ARCSS,106.295,An Analysis of the Carbon Balance of the Arctic Basin from 1997 to 2006,"These data sets are the results of a model-data analysis of the contemporary C balance of the Arctic system. CO2 and CH4 exchange between the terrestrial ecosystems of the basin and the atmosphere, along with the export of dissolved organic C (DOC) to the Arctic Ocean, were estimated using the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). The TEM considers the effects of a number of factors on its simulations of C dynamics including changes in atmospheric CO2, tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition, climate, and disturbance/land use including fire, forest harvest, and agricultural establishment/abandonment. We used the methane dynamics module of TEM (MDM-TEM) to estimate the exchange of CH4 with atmosphere of both wetlands. The MDM-TEM considers the effects of a number of factors on its simulations of CH4 dynamics including the area of wetlands, fluctuations in the water table of wetlands, temperature, and labile carbon inputs into the soil solution derived from the net primary production (NPP) estimates of TEM. 
The results of these simulations were compared with estimates of CO2 and CH4 exchange from atmospheric inversion models and with observations of terrestrial C export from Arctic watersheds. The simulated transfer of land-based C to the Arctic Ocean was compared against estimates based on a sampling of DOC export from major Arctic rivers (McClelland et al., 2008). We summarize our estimates of surface-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange for the land and ocean area matching the three high-latitude regions defined in the Transcom 3 model experiments (Gurney et al., 2002), namely the Boreal North America, Boreal Asia and Northern Ocean regions."
ARCSS,106.292,Canadian Archipelago Throughflow Study (CATS),"This dataset is part of the Canadian Archipelago Throughflow Study (CATS), a coordinated, multi-investigator program whose goal is to understand and estimate flow through the main passages of the Canadian Archipelago, including Nares Strait and Jones Sound, Barrow Strait, the downstream flow through Davis Strait and circulation and water-mass properties in the upstream Arctic source region. This freshwater export can have global implications, as it enters the North Atlantic precisely in the regions where deep North Atlantic waters are formed, in the Nordic and Labrador Seas. 
During 2003-06, The Canadian Archipelago Throughflow Study, as a part of the Arctic Sub-Arctic Ocean Flux (ASOF) experiment, deployed an array of ocean-sensing instruments at 80.5N latitude to investigate the flux of seawater from the Arctic Ocean via Nares Strait, the pathway to the west of Greenland. Additionally, data was gathered from a Healy cruise through the region. 
This data set contains Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data from both the United States Coast Guard Cutter HEALY (USCGC Healy) and moorings in the Nares Strait.

Parameters measured include: 1) thermal conductivity, 2) thermal resistivity, 3)specific heat, 4) thermal diffusivity, 5) r-squared (goodness of fit), and 6) sediment temperature. Measurements in water depths of 0.5 and 1.0 meter were made by a person standing in the water, using a PVC extension rod. A boat was used to reach lake sediments in water depths of 1.5 meters or greater. Slight boat movements during the time of measurement had an impact on data accuracy, although any data points that were obviously unreliable were thrown out and are not included in this dataset. All data that have been saved have r-squared values of at least 0.96. Measurement time by the KD-2 Pro typically takes a few minutes."

This proposed research addresses scientific questions through four main components designed to: (1) characterize the abundance, composition, and age of soil organic carbon (OC) and the abundance and structure of ground ice in relation to geomorphic environments, (2) estimate the total OC flux along the entire Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast and develop empirical models based on terrain and oceanographic factors to assess the vulnerability of the coasts to increased erosion resulting from a longer fetch due to sea-ice retreat, (3) to determine the biogeochemical transformation and bioavailability of OC associated with various dissolved and particulate forms as they cross the land/sea interface through field study and controlled laboratory experimentation; and (4) integrate our results to the pan-arctic scale through international collaboration with the Arctic Coastal Dynamics program. 
The study will involve extensive sampling at 50 random locations along the entire coast to develop precise estimates of OC abundance and flux with explicit confidence limits. Intensive sampling at three key sites that represent the dominant coastline types will be conducted to evaluate the transformation of the eroded OC. Three additional secondary sites will be established to broaden the monitoring to other coastline types and to involve local communities in the assessment of coastal changes."
ARCSS,106.209,Social Survey Data on Water Resources in Five Seward Peninsula Inupiaq Communities,"The data were collected using a social survey approach in cooperation with five rural Inupiaq communities on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. A questionnaire survey was used during a semi-structured interview. Interview questions included a series of questions about the respondent's use of water in the village (natural water sources used, use of a municipal water source if present), their perception of the quality and quantity of those water sources, and their perception of change in those water sources over the period of time with which they had familiarity with the water source. Individuals were asked what their perception of change in the quality and availability (quantity) of community water sources was. Water sources referred typically included the municipal supply (present in two of the five villages) and the major river or creek used by the village."

SAR is an active sensor, mounted on both the Canadian Space Agency RADARSAT-1 satellite and the European Remote Sensing Agency ERS-2 satellite. As the sensors orbit the earth, the radar signals are transmitted and then it measures how strongly those signals are scattered back. The SAR sensors can see both at night and through clouds. RADARSAT-1 data are in R files, ERS data are in E files. Each zip file contains documentation in an .xml file. 
These images from the Barrow Area Information Database are included as a result of efforts of the Systems Ecology Lab at the University of Texas at El Paso. Access to this data set is restricted. To obtain SAR source data from the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), users must submit a proposal to NASA for approval. Once a user has been approved to access the data and has required login information, one must use the online search tools for ASF's Data Active Archive Center (DAAC) to locate relevant scenes and to place orders.

ARCSS,106.261,Summer Warmth Index Average from 1982-2003,"This data set contains land surface temperatures in the circumpolar region of the Arctic derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data. The AVHRR data were compiled from 1982 to 2003, providing the longest satellite temperature record available. The length of this record, especially the inclusion of the earliest years, was important in producing a mean that characterized the conditions that created the present distribution of arctic vegetation. Arctic vegetation communities are only beginning to respond to recent climate changes, and our goal was to minimize this effect in the temperature data. 
The AVHRR temperature data provide better spatial resolution than modeled data sets, which interpolate between climate stations. And arctic climate stations are few, unevenly distributed around the pole, and located mostly along coasts. The finer spatial resolution and coarser temporal resolution of the AVHRR temperature data are more appropriate for analyzing vegetation distribution."
ARCSS,106.262,Landscape Age of the Arctic,"This data set is of landscape age of the Arctic, in 1000 years since the land surface was available for vegetation colonization. It is in vector format. The age of most recent deglaciation, emergence from the sea, or drainage of proglacial lakes was obtained from a compilation of Quaternary glaciations, available in digital format (Ehlers and Gibbard, 2004). Supplemental data provided in some of the regional chapters were especially useful. Although landscape age estimates are bound to change as research continues, the compilation used in this study includes the best available current estimates, and provides a relatively robust data set for analysis at a circumpolar scale. 
All dates in this study are in calendar years. Dates for Canada were converted from 14C years to calendar years (Dyke, 2004). Data are in 1000 calendar years."

The data were obtained during the Transdrift VI expedition to the Laptev Sea in April and May of 1999 as part of a project supported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program. Sea ice cores were obtained with a 10 cm diameter corer. Ice thickness was measured in centimeters at the site with a tape measure. On-site, 2 cm thick horizontal sections were cut approximately every 10 cm down the core. Salinity of each sample was determined in practical salinity units (psu) using a salinity, conductivity, and temperature meter with an error of less than 0.02 or 1 percent of bulk salinity. Oxygen stable isotope (delta oxygen-18, or delta 18-O) measurements were then performed at the Stable Isotope Laboratory (Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada) on a mass spectrometer at a precision of better than 0.4 parts per thousand (ppt, 10 3). 
Data are compiled into one comma-separated variable (CSV) ASCII file, named icecoredata.csv. The single ASCII file is approximately 6 KB. The file contains data in 96 rows by 10 columns. The top row is a header that indicates the content of the various columns. Data are compiled for each coring location, though stable isotope measurements were not obtained for all samples."

From the perspective of many hunters and elders in the Arctic, the weather has been uggianaqtuq in recent years. Inuit from two communities in Nunavut, Canada (Baker Lake and Clyde River), share their observations and perspectives on recent environmental changes. The CD-ROM is a pilot project that uses media technology, as opposed to written reports, as an alternative way to document and communicate Inuit observations and knowledge. It is a research product/report for the communities involved, as well as others interested in how Inuit are experiencing environmental change. Maps, text, photos, video and music are integrated to help illustrate the changes Inuit have observed in their environment and the impacts on their livelihoods. The integrated components allow the user to 
* search by topic or the person being interviewed 
* view interview clips in Inuktitut with English interpretations 
* view and print maps about environmental changes drawn by participants 
* view short videos with scenes from the communities

ARCSS,106.ARCSS129,Circulation in the Freshwater Switchyard of the Arctic Ocean: University of Washington CTD Profile Data,"The Freshwater Switchyard of the Arctic Ocean (FSAO) project is a program to study freshwater circulation (sea ice and upper ocean) in the freshwater switchyard between Alert (Ellesmere Island) and the North Pole, through a series of annual springtime hydrographic surveys. An aircraft based at Alert on northern Ellesmere Island carries out the oceanographic surveys northward across the shelf break in late spring. These surveys are intended to measure the eastward-flowing boundary current and determine water property changes that occur in the transition from the deep Arctic Ocean basin to the shallow continental shelf. 
Measurements were made to 500m in late April and May of 2003-2009 using a Seabird Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE) 19plus SeaCAT internally recording CTD instrument with an Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE) 43 dissolved oxygen sensor. Data include depth, pressure, temperature in situ, potential temperature, conductivity, salinity, density and, if available, dissolved oxygen. In recent years, we have begun offering dissolved oxygen profiles in a separate archive to allow a different processing pathway. The basic CTD archives are preferred for all purposes that do not require oxygen. 
Through 2007, the aircraft was a Bell 206 helicopter. In April-May 2007, the worst Arctic flying weather in many years was encountered, negatively impacting many investigations. At Alert, a very wide shore lead evaporating ice fog never relented long enough to allow the helicopter to safely reach the study areas, so no data is included for 2007. In 2008, we used a Twin Otter skiplane to obtain many stations, at a cost of not being able to reach precise station positions from previous years. The 2009 data used primary Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE)-19 plus CTD (s/n 4344) was an Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE)-43 Dissolved Oxygen Sensor (s/n 408). Beginning with Cast 8, backup Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE)-19 (s/n 2373) with Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE)-43 (s/n 1406) was substituted, and that station recorded an excellent profile of oxygen as well as temperature and conductivity. The backup CTD itself failed completely at the first station the following day, for reasons under investigation by the manufacturer. At that point it was felt the safest course was to complete the survey removing the Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE)-43 from the primary CTD, to optimize our chances of collecting good CTD data. The result is 18 stations of quality CTD profiles, but only one (Cast 8) with oxygen. 
In 2010, Airborne Expendable CTD Probes were dropped into open leads from the Twin to record an ocean section across the north end of Nares Strait."
ARCSS,106.304,Toward Reanalysis of the Arctic Climate System - Sea Ice and Ocean Reconstruction with Data Assimilation,"The major goal of this project was to develop an integrated set of data assimilation procedures for the ice-ocean system that is able to provide gridded data sets that are physically consistent and constrained to the observations of sea ice and ocean parameters. The project uses modern four-dimensional variational (4D-Var, adjoint) data assimilation methods. Sea ice and ocean models with new data assimilation procedures were employed to maximize the integration of model results with observations and thus attempt to provide the arctic research community with complete and accurate data sets for 3 different climate regimes, namely: 1972-1978, 1989-1996, and 1997-2006. The reconstructed monthly mean water temperature, salinity and currents at standard for above mentioned climate regimes are provided in figures and in gridded digital form."

ARCSS,106.306,Humans and Hydrology at High Latitudes: Water Use Information,"This data set contains water use information for Canadian and Alaskan communities as well as general water-use estimates provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the whole of the United States. These data are utilized in the Arctic Rapid Integrated Monitoring System (ArcticRIMS) project to improve the development of the water stress model. This water stress model shows the effects of water resources, humans and climate change in the Arctic. 
Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-arctic scale, a system of arctic typologies were used to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. Those mature data sets were used to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle. The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future."

ARCSS,106.ARCSS130,A Half-Century of Change in Arctic Alaskan Shrubs: A Photographic-Based Assessment," In this study, the locations of 193 old aerial photographs of northern Alaskan landscapes were rephotographed and assessed for changes in vegetation. The original photographs were taken over northern Alaska between 1948 and 1951, and the new photographs were taken between 1999 and 2003. The region covered by the original and repeat photographs stretches from the southern extent of the Brooks Range in the south to the Coastal Plain in the north, and from the Chukchi Sea in the west to the Canning River in the east.  
 The original photographs were taken by the U.S. military as part of geologic reconnaissance and exploration, and the method used to acquire them was to fly both sides of a river valley while photographing the river and the facing valley slopes. Of the several thousand original photographs, only a fraction were repeated for the purpose of assessing vegetation change. Repeat photographs were selected for geographic coverage and to produce the greatest likelihood of detecting vegetation change. The original and repeat photographs were then scanned and stored in TIFF format. Individual image file sizes range from 5 to 60 MB each, and the total file size for the data set is approximately 11 GB.  
 The images should not be published without the consent of the investigators. "
ARCSS,106.ARCSS142,SHEBA Ocean Turbulence Mast Data Archive,"This data set includes a time series of temperature, conductivity, salinity, three-dimensional velocity, pressure, and magnetic heading at multiple levels in the boundary layer under the drifting ice floe. As part of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project, data were collected continuously for the approximately year-long experiment. However, the experiment was divided roughly in half when a severe deformation event occurred in March 1998. After this event, the ocean camp was shifted to a new site farther into the SHEBA floe. 
In the first half of the experiment (October 1997 through March 1998), there were four turbulence instrument clusters (TIC) that included three mechanical rotor current meters, which sensed the mean flow velocity. These were oriented approximately at 4 m, 8 m, 12 m, and 16 m below the ice-ocean interface in the western Arctic Ocean. For the second half of the experiment (April through September 1998), only two TICs were deployed on the mast. The clusters measured mean quantities, turbulent momentum, and heat fluxes with reasonable approximations to salinity flux. 
Data were originally distributed on a DVD but are now available as a single .tar.gz file that contains the contents of the DVD. The file is about 1GB in size."

Note: Files were updated on 04 Jan 12. Most of the data are the same (with same units) but in all years now photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) has been replaced by incoming shortwave global solar radiation in the spectral range from 310 to 2800 nm (unit is Wm-2). This radiation for 2006-2008 is from the BEC tower, while for 2005: from 1 to 29 July the radiation is from ARM-Barrow and after the 29 July until the end of August is again from BEC. Because the ARM site is closer to the coast from the BE sites and it is more cloudy a regression of the data from 1-29 July was performed to match conditions at the BE."

ARCSS,106.336,Ecosystem metabolism for an arctic warm spring-stream,"This dataset investigated the productivity of a perennial, Arctic spring-stream. Ivishak Spring has the stable discharge (~131 L/s) and temperature (~4-8 deg C) typical for springs. It is unusual, however, in having an annual cycle of daylight from 24 hrs/d (summer) to 0 hrs/d (winter). It tested the hypothesis that stored detritus would buffer carbon limitation during winter when gross primary production (GPP) is minimized, resulting in constant rates of community respiration (CR) year-round due to constant temperatures. It used open-channel methods to measure GPP and CR monthly from March 2007 to August 2009. Mean annual GPP was 458 gC/m2. Such a level is typical for temperate desert-streams but was surprising for an Arctic stream. Annual CR (887 gC/m2) was also remarkable. The high metabolism of this stream is explained by an open canopy, moderate year-round temperatures, stable bed, and high bryophyte biomass (48 gAFDM/m2). Strong seasonal cycles of GPP were mirrored by CR (r=0.65) indicating the possibility of carbon limitation during winter. This result falsified our hypothesis that CR would be relatively stable year-round due to a detritus buffer and constant temperature

ARCSS,106.ARCSS088,North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) Aerial CTD Survey,"This data set contains North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) Aerial CTD Survey data. It includes conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), pressure, salinity, potential temperature, and density data, which were collected yearly in the Arctic Ocean as part of the NPEO. Investigators landed a helicopter or skiplane on the arctic sea ice and took measurements using a Seabird SBE-19 SeaCAT with a portable winch. They processed the data using the SEASOFT recipe to minimize salinity spiking and correct for a thermal lag of the conductivity cell. Certain constants were determined by empirical trial, which differed slightly for each year. 
The NPEO is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year.

ARCSS,106.334,Albedo of ice types in northeast Greenland's ablation zone,"Ice types, albedos and impurity content are characterized for the ablation zone of the Greenland ice sheet in Kronprinz Christians Land (808 N, 248 W). Along this ice margin the width of the ablation zone is only about 8 km. The emergence and melting of old ice in the ablation zone creates a surface layer of dust that was originally deposited with snowfall high on the ice sheet. This debris cover is augmented by locally derived wind-blown sediment. Subsequently, the surface dust particles often aggregate together to form centimetre-scale clumps that melt into the ice, creating cryoconite holes. The debris in the cryoconite holes becomes hidden from sunlight, raising the area-averaged albedo relative to surfaces with uniform debris cover. Spectral and broadband albedos were obtained for snow, ice hummocks, debris-covered ice, cryoconite-studded ice and barren tundra surfaces. Broadband ice albedos varied from 0.2 (for ice with heavy loading of uniform debris) to 0.6 (for ice hummocks with cryoconite holes). The cryoconite material itself has albedo 0.1 when wet."

Almost all samples were collected in the spring season (March to early May) when the combination of snow cover and exposure to sunlight is maximized, and before the snow had started to melt. In many locations (Canadian Arctic, Russia, Greenland, Troms and Ny lesund) samples were gathered at intervals throughout the snowpack depth, giving information on the seasonal evolution of BC concentrations as the snow accumulated (and/or sublimated) throughout the winter. In addition to estimated BC mixing ratios, we give maximum possible BC concentration, the absorption Angstrom exponent of all light-absorbing aerosol in the snow, and the fraction of spectrally-integrated, solar-spectrum-weighted absorption by non-BC absorbers."

ARCSS,106.348,Near-shore Topography Transects of Barrow area Lakes,"Near-shore topography transects perpendicular to the lake shore were conducted using a Sokkia C310 Automatic Level and survey rod. Survey transects logged location, elevation, and surface condition (e.g., vegetation, snow/ice, or water) at approximately three meter intervals. The transect also measured bathymetry along the transect for several meters into the lake where possible. Survey stations were logged in space by Trimble 5700 GPS receiver with a Zephyr Geodetic antenna. The horizontal accuracy of the Differential GPS (DGPS) point, based on the DGPS point processing reports, was approximately 20 cm. Although vertical accuracy was roughly 200 cm for the DGPS tie point, the accuracy of the transect points relative to each other was ~1cm. 
Most lakes in the area are unnamed so for this study, the lakes were named L and then a number counting up from 100 for lakes mapped in 2008, 200 for lakes mapped in 2009, and 300 for lakes mapped in 2010.

ARCSS,106.349,Lake Water Level and Temperature from Pressure Sensors," Water level and temperature measurements were collected hourly in June through August for the years 2008 through 2010 several lakes near Barrow and Atqasuk, Alaska. Solinst Levelogger Jr. water level and temperature sensors were used. Water level measurements were compensated for changes in barometric pressure using a Solinst Barologger Gold which was installed on the land surface near the lakes. Loggers were attached to a cable which had an anchor (sandbag) and float. Rafting lake ice moved sensors for the first weeks of each season until complete ice melt-out (generally in late June to early July). Data from the ice rafting periods has been removed from each sensor record.

ARCSS,106.350,"Temperature, discharge and light data for Ivishak Hot Spring, Alaska","The productivity of a perennial, Arctic spring-stream was investigated. Ivishak Spring has the stable discharge (~131 L/s) and temperature (~4-8 deg C) typical for springs. It is unusual, however, in having an annual cycle of daylight from 24 hrs/d (summer) to 0 hrs/d (winter). It was tested from the hypothesis that stored detritus would buffer carbon limitation during winter when gross primary production (GPP) is minimized, resulting in constant rates of community respiration (CR) year-round due to constant temperatures. Open-channel methods were used to measure GPP and CR monthly from March 2007 to August 2009. Mean annual GPP was 458 gC/m2. Such a level is typical for temperate desert streams but was surprising for an Arctic stream. Annual CR (887 gC/m2) was also remarkable. The high metabolism of this stream is explained by an open canopy, moderate year-round temperatures, stable bed, and high bryophyte biomass (48 gAFDM/m2). Strong seasonal cycles of GPP were mirrored by CR (r=0.65) indicating the possibility of carbon limitation during winter. This result falsified the hypothesis that CR would be relatively stable year-round due to a detritus buffer and constant temperature."

Also, from the measured speed of sound, virtual potential temperature was also obtained. 
Wind velocities and virtual potential temperature were acquired at 10 Hz. Meteorological variables such as wind speed and direction were obtained from vector-averaging the horizontal wind velocities over 1 minute intervals. Turbulent fluxes, such as friction velocities and sensible heat flux, were obtained from covariances of wind velocities and temperature over 15 minute averages. The longer time scale allows for adequate sampling of larger atmospheric eddies that contribute to the measured flux. Wind speeds and direction are accurate to +/- 0.03 m/s and +/- 0.1 degrees, respectively, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Turbulent fluxes are estimated to be accurate to +/- 10-15% due to statistical sampling issues."
ARCSS,106.371,Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) Photosynthesis-Irradiance Experiments,"The objective of the Circumpolar Flaw Lead (CFL) project is to examine how physical changes affect biological processes within the flaw lead.

ARCSS,106.427,Adaptive long-term fasting in land and ice-bound polar bears: Data Table,"The data sets in the data table have been collected as part of a project to understand how reduced sea ice cover in the Arctic will impact polar bear populations. Bears that stay ashore in summer have almost no access to food and tend to be inactive. Those that stay on the ice, however, have continued access to prey and make extensive movements. Over a three year period, scientists from the University of Wyoming and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) followed the movements of bears in both habitats and monitored their body temperature, muscle condition, blood chemistry, and metabolism. The physiological data will be added to spatially-explicit individual-based population models to predict population response to reduced ice cover."

ARCSS,106.438,History of the Arctic Flora in North America,"This dataset in an attempt to increase understanding of how climate cycles of the Quaternary (the last 2.6 million years) impacted divergence in Arctic and alpine tundra flora. Specimens were collected in Beringia and the mountains of western North America, focusing on populations existing within (western and eastern Beringia, and the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains, respectively), as well as sites between those refugia. Briefly, DNA was sequenced from chloroplast and nuclear loci for multiple species of tundra plants that inhabited the entire study region. Target species (Campanula species, Kobresia myosuroides, Lloydia serotina, Pinguicula vulgaris, Poa alpina, Rhodiola species, and Saxifraga species) were phylogenetically diverse and displayed a range of dispersal abilities, making them excellent candidates for evaluating general history of the tundra. Those genetic data make up this Arctic Flora dataset. From the genetic sequence data, gene trees are being reconstructed and used to estimate the patterns and timing of divergence, test which geologic and climatic events most impacted divergence, and infer how the process of genetic divergence differed between Arctic and alpine tundra refugia.



The data is archived in nexus files - the standard format for aligned sequence data ready to be used in a phylogenetic analysis. The files are separated by taxon and genetic locus within a given taxon. The nexus format provides details on the data type (DNA), number of samples, and length of sequence. Within a file, all the sequences are aligned but not interleaved, such that the 'sample name' is followed by the entire sequence for that sample. All the specimens that were collected are archived and publicly accessible in the Western Washington University Herbarium."

ARCSS,106.448,"Understanding Climate-Driven Phenological Change - Observations, Adaptations and Cultural Implications in Northeastern Siberia and Labrador/Nunatsiavut (PHENARC)","An important focus of the PHENARC project has been on qualitative climatic data from Labrador/Nunatsiavut. For this location, instrumental and qualitative meterological observations began in August 1771, when the Unitas Fratrum or Unity of the Brethren, established its first mission among the Inuit on the Labrador coast. The Moravian Brethren, as they are more commonly known, comprise a Christian church that has pre-reformation origins that go back to the Bohemian reformer Jan Hus (c. 1375-1415). Matthus Stach (1711-1787) was the pioneer of the Moravian Greenland missionaries, and it was he who advocated missionary work among the Inuit of the Labrador coast. 
The data cover all the missionary stations in Labrador; Nain, Okak, Hopedale, Hebron, Ramah and Makkovik. The station with the greatest data coverage is Nain. The observations of the missionaries lasted until 1939 when they were taken over by the Canadian Meteorological Service. After World War II, the missionaries lost their ties with the Inuit population and their missionary stations were regrouped. The last missionary left Nain in 2005. However, the Moravian church is still strong in many parts of Labrador. These documentary sources form a veritable goldmine and are discussed in the papers contained in this data set."

The unusual hydrology of this system relative to most other lakes studied for paleoclimate in this region provides a novel insight into different seasonal aspects of Alaskan paleoclimatology. The record is consistent with a general long-term decrease in wintertime precipitation, possibly accompanied by an increase in permafrost extent, over the Holocene."

BEST,102.079,Spring Chlorophyll Concentrations on the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf,"The eastern Bering Sea shelf supports productive marine ecosystems with extraordinarily valuable fisheries and subsistence resources, but sub-arctic seas are predicted to be one of the regions most sensitive to future warming of the world's oceans. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on the extent, duration and timing of sea-ice over the Bering Sea shelf. Sea-ice controls the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom, the fate of primary production, water column temperature and salinity, and provides a haul out and molting platform for marine mammals. Thus, the most urgent priority of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) is to examine the role of changing sea-ice conditions on the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of the ecosystem. The first BEST cruise was scheduled on the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy in April-May 2007, however, physical observations, water column nutrient chemistry, and zooplankton distribution / abundance were not among the ecosystem components funded in the first call for proposals.

BEST,102.167,TN249-10 Microzooplankton Grazing and Phytoplankton Growth Rates,"During the R/V Thompson long spring Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) cruise in May-June 2010, 18 dilution experiments were carried out. We compared the rates of algal growth in whole water and in 10 % whole water diluted with particle-free filtered water over a 24 hour day- night cycle at light levels of 15% to 30% of surface incident light. 11 experiments yielded significant microzooplankton grazing rates. Phytoplankton growth rates varied from slightly negative, probably due to a senescent diatom bloom, to a maximum daily rate of 0.39 d-1 where initial chl-a concentration was low, only 0.5 micro-g l-1. Microzooplankton grazing impact ranged from negligible to more that 3 times daily phytoplankton growth. On average, microzooplankton grazing mortality was about 63% of daily phytoplankton growth. The average grazing impact in 2010 was higher than that found in the spring during the 2008 and 2009 cruises when much of the cruise track was in heavy sea ice. Because less time was spent in the ice and the season was more advanced, the experiment incubation temperatures, from 0.4 to 5 degrees C, were somewhat higher during the 2010 cruise compared to the previous 2 spring cruises."

BEST,102.176,HLY-09-02 Microzooplankton Grazing,"During the 2009 US Coast Guard Cutter Healy Long Spring cruise, HLY0902, microzooplankton grazing experiments were completed at 16 process stations using the dilution assay approach in on-deck incubations at ambient water temperatures. Sampling during the first part of the cruise was under heavy ice conditions with low algal biomass in the water column; during the second half of the cruise significant diatom blooms were encountered. At two stations with high chlorophyll-a, data are reported for separate assays on the same water sample in which nutrients were or were not added at the beginning of the experiments. The data set presents phytoplankton intrinsic growth rates (day^-1) in the absence of grazing and microzooplankton grazing impact on phytoplankton (day^-1). Date station locations, depth of water taken for each experiment, and initial chlorophyll-a concentrations are also provided."
BEST,102.177,TN249-10 - Lipofuscin and Euphausiid Aging,"Age determination in crustaceans relies on quantification of a fluorescent age pigment, lipofuscin, that accumulates in eye stalks of krill over time. Lipofuscin includes a mixture of protein oxidation products formed in neural tissues. The extracted products are quantified using a fluorescence detector. The concentration of lipofuscin is normalized to the protein content from the same tissues. The ratio of lipofuscin to protein concentration is the Lipofuscin Index and is calculated for each individual organism. In order for the index to reflect chronological age, a calibration is required using euphausiids of known age. A comparison of the calculated ages to the specific lengths for each krill provides the ages for those krill analyzed during each cruise. These data were collected aboard the UNOLS R/V Thompson ship."

BEST,102.162,BEST 2008-2009 Bottom-Anchored Moorings,"In a collaborative effort between University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and University of Washington (UW), this dataset addresses the impact of physical variability on the processes and structure of the Bering shelf ecosystem, with special emphasis on how freshwater redistributed by the shelf circulation or introduced from sea ice modifies stratification and nutrient distributions. In particular, the effort seeks to understand how changes in sea ice affect advection and mixing; how variable fluxes of low-salinity, nutrient-deficient (but iron-rich) coastal waters affect production; how cross-shelf fluxes are established and altered; how these fluxes might respond to climate change; how the seasonal stratification cycle is controlled; and how the buoyant coastal flow evolves. The dataset is using moored instruments and shipboard hydrography (including extensive 18O sampling) to address this problem set. 
The first set of UAF-UW BEST moorings, nine in all, was deployed in July 2008 from the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The locations of the moorings are shown in Figure 1 as red squares, circles, and stars; the red triangles denote NOAA moorings. Depending on depth, the moorings carry various instrumentation. For example, at the outermost locations on each line (square, circle, and star), over the 55 m isobath, each mooring has an ice-avoiding modem-linked temperature / conductivity recorder at 10 m, another temperature / conductivity recorder with fluorometer at 22 m, below that a chain of 15 precision temperature recorders, and then an acoustic Doppler current profiler at 46 m and another temperature/conductivity recorder 2 m above the bottom. 
These moorings were recovered and replaced with similar ones in July 2009 from aboard the R/V Point Sur. The data reported here are from the first deployment, 2008-2009. Note: this is version 2 of the data, updated on March 19, 2011."

BEST,102.278,Pelagic distribution and abundance of seabirds in the PROBES area,"This data set includes data from the PROBES area, gathered by multiple observers in multiple projects, since 1975. The data were gathered in strip transects, generally 300 m wide and recorded in the data base as densities. Over that period, there has been a change in the method for recoding flying birds. Pre 2000, most if not all data on flying birds was recorded continuously, which can result in an inflated number of birds recorded per unit area. After 2000, most flying birds were recorded with the snap-shot method. The data in this dataset were retrieved from the USGS maintained North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database, version 2, which is expected to be on line by late 2014, which have not been adjusted for the change in recording methods. Such a calibration was made for the Hunt et al. in press paper listed below, and information on calibration methods are in that paper and in the Renner et al paper below in related links."

Mean water column temperature was significantly lower during June 1999 than June 1998 and 1997. Copepod abundance and biomass during June were correlated with mean water column temperature and mean temperature below the thermocline. Mean calanoid abundance during June 1999 was 8 - 52 % of the mean abundance during 1998 and 1997. Significantly lower abundances during June 1999 were observed for Calanus marshallae, Acartia spp., Pseudocalanus spp. and calanoid nauplii. Significant interannual differences in mean water column temperature and calanoid abundance during late summer (late July-early September) were not detected. The Hirst-Lampitt equations were used to estimate the mean daily copepod production during the warm and cold years."

ITEX,56.958,"Toolik Litter Study [Welker, J., J. Fahnestock]","The data set presented here represents part of a study that examined the ecological consequences of allochthonous litter deposition in tundra communities near Toolik Lake, Alaska. The study indicates that wintertime litter redistribution is an important mechanism of nutrient transfer across the Arctic landscape, increasing C and nutrient inputs to some portions of the landscape while decreasing their availability in other areas. Accumulation of windblown litter modifies the physical and chemical environment of patchy areas of the landscape and significantly alters some important biological processes such as respiration. Data are for control and litter plots and include net ecosystem CO2 exchange (umol m-2 s-1), photosynthesis (umol m-2 s-1), respiration (umol m-2 s-1), soil temperature at 5 cm (degrees C), and various dates for key phenological events (snow free, first green leaf visible, first flower petal visible, first flower open, first petal drop, last petal drop, first color change, and seed dispersal) for six important dry heath tundra plant species.

PacMARS,255.013,Chukchi Sea Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA): Chemical and Benthos (CAB) [Dunton],"The Chukchi Sea Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA) Chemical and Benthos (CAB) is a comprehensive program funded by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) that is designed to establish an integrated knowledge of this biologically productive and diverse ecosystem. 
The CAB component addresses the benthic system with a particular emphasis on sediment chemical characteristics and the benthic biota, both infaunal and epifaunal. Objectives include: 
1. To establish baseline data set for benthic infauna and epifauna, organic carbon and sediment grain size, radioisotopes for down core dating, as well as measure trace metals in sediments, biota and suspended particles. 
2. To determine the sources, cycles and fate of carbon, selected trace metals and the role of trace metals on organic carbon dynamics and food web dynamics on the inner shelf of the Chukchi Sea. 
Data from sampling efforts in 2009 and 2010 reveal that sediments contain low or background values for metals and aliphatic hydrocarbons (except for a few notable exceptions), and that the northern whelk, Neptunea heros, is a potentially valuable indicator for metals and organic contaminants. The northeastern Chukchi Sea is a productive and highly complex system that is characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity in both benthic infaunal and epifaunal populations.

PacMARS,255.014,LSL2002-23 Macrofauna Data [Bluhm],"This dataset investigates the macrobenthos of the Canada Basin, which is one of the biologically least known areas of the Arctic deep sea. Macro-infauna was collected with 11 box cores at six stations ranging from 640 to 3250 m water depth between 16 August 2002 and 5 September 2002. Total abundance ranged from 3 to 265 individuals per 0.04 square meters (75 - 6625 individuals per square meter) and decreased with increasing depth. Biomass ranged from 0.04 to 228 mg wet weight per 0.04 m2 (1-5700 mg wet weight per square meter) and followed the same trend. Polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves dominated the faunal densities, biomass and species numbers. Over 70 benthic invertebrate species from four biogeographic affinities were identified, including at least three new species of Isopoda. The evident low abundances and biomass are in agreement with findings from the Eurasian Arctic deep sea. 
This data set is in Excel format, and presents the foundation for a scientific publication: Bluhm BA, MacDonald IR, Debenham C, Iken K (2005) Macro- and megabenthic communities in the high Arctic Canada Basin: initial findings. Polar Biology (spec. issue) 28:218-231. 
Taxonomists that assisted with species identifications are listed in the publication. This data set has the unique catalog number 2005B1. This data set contains the raw counts for each box core replicate sample, mostly per 0.04 m2. In most cases, no replicates could be obtained due to time constraints.

PacMARS,255.015,HLY-05-02 Macrofauna Data [Bluhm],"This dataset contains soft bottom metazoan infauna (larger than 250 micrometer) that was collected with 33 box cores at 11 stations ranging from 817 m to 3961 m water depth in the high Arctic Canada Basin from 28 June to 25 July 2005. Total infauna abundance ranged from 0.6 to 50 individuals per 0.06 square meter (89-2722 individuals per square meter) and total biomass ranged from 0.2-1.6 g wet weight per 0.06 square meter (less than 0.1-26.1 g wet weight per square meter). Infauna taxon number per station was between 8 and 55. Abundance, biomass, taxon number and diversity indices of infauna declined significantly with water depth. Polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves dominated the infaunal densities, biomass and species numbers. A total of 99 infauna taxa were identified, including at least three new species of polychaetes. 
Multivariate analysis indicated that station groups Chukchi slope, Canada Basin abyss and Chukchi Cap were moderately, but significantly, different in the infauna samples, but could not be similarly distinguished as such in the epifauna photographs. This data set contains the raw counts for each box core replicate sample, mostly per 0.06 m2 (20x30 cm) for replicates 1 and 2, and per 0.03 m2 for replicate 3.

PacMARS,255.020,Oil Industry Benthic Ecology Data [Blanchard],"Primary production reaching the sea floor is consumed by benthic organisms (animals living in or closely associated with sediments) allowing these communities to flourish in the Chukchi Sea. Prior work in the Chukchi Sea has been broadly focused and smaller-scale information is needed. Thus, invertebrate organisms dwelling in sediments (macrofauna including marine worms, clams, snails, and other small animals) and larger, mobile animals on top of the sediments (megafauna including brittle stars, sea stars, sea cucumbers, crabs, and shrimps) are sampled to understand the ecology of the benthic fauna in the study areas. The study is investigating relationships between invertebrate community composition and environmental characteristics to understand what factors influence community structures. The benthic team is also evaluating invertebrate food-web structure through tissue isotope analysis. Compared to other studies in the area, the smaller scale of the Chukchi Sea Environmental Studies Program (CSESP) allows for stronger insights into the geologic and oceanographic factors structuring and influencing benthic animals in the region.

PacMARS,255.037,"Oil Industry Study Logistics Data [Olgoonik Fairweather, LLC]","In February 2008, ConocoPhillips (COP), Shell Exploration  Production (Shell) and Statoil USA Exploration and Production (Statoil) obtained leases in the federal waters of the Chukchi Sea, and immediately began an integrated ecosystem-based environmental studies program to gather baseline, or pre-exploration, data. COP operated the program during the open-water seasons of 2008 and 2009 on behalf of itself and Shell. In 2010 and 2011, Olgoonik-Fairweather LLC (OLF) operated the Chukchi Sea environmental studies program funded by COP, Shell, and Statoil.



In 2008 and 2009, the program consisted of two prospect-specific study areas for ConocoPhillips and Shell, and in 2010, an additional prospect-specific study area was added for Statoil. The program expanded in 2011 to include a more regional area survey that encompasses the three prospect-specific study areas and Hanna Shoal to the north. The study design was based on the systematic sample and transect grid used in 2008-2010, but on a coarser scale to cover a greater area in a shorter amount of time. To allow for data continuity, the 2008-2010 prospect-specific study areas remain at the finer transect scale.



The overall purpose of the study is to provide to ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Statoil necessary baseline information about the marine environment in their respective lease areas that can be used in applications for permits, in a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance document, and in other documents to help manage these resources. The study will provide valuable information for the regulatory agencies to conduct realistic evaluations on the potential impacts of oil and gas activities and thus issue permits with reasonable stipulations and guidance. Importantly, it will also contribute to the overall knowledge of the northeastern Chukchi Sea marine ecosystem.

Phytoplankton, along with algae that grow attached to sea ice, are the conduit of the sun's energy into organic food at the base of the food chain in the Chukchi Sea. Phytoplankton are assessed as chlorophyll-a concentration from water samples collected with a Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) rosette. We also measure the concentration of the major nutrients required for their growth in these samples. Zooplankton are the major consumers of phytoplankton, and hence the key pathway to vertebrates such as pelagic fish, seabirds, and even bowhead whales. Zooplankton are collected using two different methods: paired ring nets of medium-size mesh hauled vertically at slow speed for smaller species, and Bongo nets towed off the side of a ship moving at 2 knots for larger, faster species.

Biologist observers, assisted by observers from the native communities, record all marine mammals sighted during daylight hours along north-south oriented transect lines. Besides species information, observers record other environmental data such as behavior, distance and movement of the animal relative to the vessel. The information obtained on marine mammal presence and distribution through visual observations augments the data collected through acoustic call detections. Combining the marine mammal data with information on the physical oceanography and of potential food organisms (plankton, benthos, and fish) contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between marine mammals and their environment.

The vast majority of stations were trawl hauls and a few were photographic sampling stations. Trawl hauls were conducted with a range of different nets including various otter trawls but mostly the 83-112 Eastern Otter trawl, and a plumb-staff beam trawl. Mesh sizes ranged from 4-38 mm in the cod end and 7-89 mm in the body of the net. Trawl duration ranged from 1-30 minutes and trawl speed ranged from 1.5-5 knots. Where available, variables compiled include cruise and station names, locations and water depth, haul and net information, contact information of data holder, as well as total abundance, biomass and taxon richness of epifaunal invertebrates. The latter is biased by varying levels of taxonomic resolution in the source data. Many fields are blank, either because the data have not yet been released as is the case for many recent cruises, or because hauls were not quantitative as is the case for some historic data sets. Data on fishes from the same hauls are not reported here. Column headers are explained in the readme file.



Changes made to the original data sets provided by the project contacts or as found in data archives include, where possible: standardization of abundance to individuals per 1000 square meters; standardization of biomass to kilograms wet weight per 1000 square meters; and subtraction of obvious infaunal taxa, eggs and fragments from the taxon count."

By observing birds July-October, we can describe spatial, seasonal, and interannual characteristics of the seabird community. We also provide detailed information on species that are of conservation concern (e.g., endangered, threatened, candidate species). The advantage of being a component of a multi-disciplinary study is that we integrate the information about seabirds in this area with the data on physical and biological oceanography that are collected concurrently by the research vessel to investigate the relationships between seabirds and their marine environment.

During this time, we sampled 42 sites (49 Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) casts) on a series of 5 transect lines which bracketed and were parallel to the SBI current meter mooring line located at 152 degrees W longitude. Stations were about 10 km apart along each transect line. Transect lines B, C, and D were at the same spacing; while, lines A and E were 20 km from the nearest transect line. A map of the achieved sampling sites is available (file: SW3LOC4A.pdf). Typically, 4-5 stations were sampled on each flying day. At each site, a Seabird CTD (either a SBE-19 or an SBE-25) and Satlantic ISUS nitrate analyzer with a water sampling bottle was deployed through an 8 inch hole augured through the pack-ice. Continuous profiles of pressure, temperature, salinity, and nitrate concentrations were made from the ice hole to either the sediment surface or to about 390 m. CTD data were processed with Seabird software (Seasoft) and the data binned into 0.5 dbar layers. Data herein are the vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and density.

SHEBA,13.820,"Helicopter Infrared Photometry [Grenfell, T.]","This is a link to EOL documentation of helicopter infrared photometry regarding aerial observations. A crucial element of SHEBA is to extend process-oriented observations and models to larger-scales. Local measurements provide data on mass changes, optical properties, and structural properties of individual ice categories, and ground surveys allowed us to define spatial variability within each category. We then use larger scale aerial surveys to generate regional estimates of the fractional area covered by these categories. Combining these observations with process-oriented modeling results makes it possible to generate aerially averaged estimates of such quantities as albedo, solar heat input to the ice and ocean, ice concentration, pond fraction, and lateral melt rates."
SHEBA,13.821,"Soot Content of Snow and Ice [Grenfell, T.]","This is EOL documentation regarding soot content of snow and ice. The presence of particulates in the snow cover and at the ice surface can decrease the spectral albedo of the system at visible wavelengths where absorption by ice and water is small. Because of this, we were concerned that the release and local deposition of soot particles from fuel burned onboard the ship could impact both albedos and melt rates."
SHEBA,13.822,"Ice Stress [Richter-Menge J., B. Elder, K. Claffey]","This is a link to EOL documentation regarding ice stress. A governing factor in the exchange of energy between the atmosphere, sea ice cover, and ocean is the thickness distribution of the ice cover. A complex series of dynamic and thermodynamic processes defines the thickness distribution. Key to the dynamic processes is the mechanical behavior of the ice cover, which described the relationship between stress and deformation."

SHEBA,106.ARCSS142,SHEBA Ocean Turbulence Mast Data Archive,"This data set includes a time series of temperature, conductivity, salinity, three-dimensional velocity, pressure, and magnetic heading at multiple levels in the boundary layer under the drifting ice floe. As part of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project, data were collected continuously for the approximately year-long experiment. However, the experiment was divided roughly in half when a severe deformation event occurred in March 1998. After this event, the ocean camp was shifted to a new site farther into the SHEBA floe. 
In the first half of the experiment (October 1997 through March 1998), there were four turbulence instrument clusters (TIC) that included three mechanical rotor current meters, which sensed the mean flow velocity. These were oriented approximately at 4 m, 8 m, 12 m, and 16 m below the ice-ocean interface in the western Arctic Ocean. For the second half of the experiment (April through September 1998), only two TICs were deployed on the mast. The clusters measured mean quantities, turbulent momentum, and heat fluxes with reasonable approximations to salinity flux.
