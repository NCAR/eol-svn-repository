  Description:
    Abstract:
      These data are part of a study detailed in Epibenthos Survey of the Bering Sea, NPRB Project B-57 Final Report.

      The study area ranged from St Lawrence Island to south of St Matthew  and Nuniavak Islands (north of 59N). Data were collected from March-May 2008.This Access database includes all summary data records from our analysis of underwater video including abiotic and biotic habitat descriptions, brittle and sea star abundance values, sediment topography values, and all non-video (i.e., grab sample) generated data. The database was also used in creating maps in ArcMap and associated GDB files are found in this file. 

      The Excel file includes results of all video analyses. Data not contained in the Access database includes details of identified fauna (GeneralDescrip worksheet) and counts (Counts Track worksheet) for each station from qualitative analysis, image still frame analysis results for 19 sites. Includes general descriptions of substrate, functional groups, classes/species that make up these groups, and additional features of note.
    Purpose: Our primary objective was to acquire and use underwater benthic video data for qualitative and quantitative epibenthic habitat characterization in the Bering Sea. The results also supplement traditional infaunal community data collections made during the two research cruises.

      Methodology_Description: We used  a benthic camera system in 2008 to determine epibenthic community structure in the BEST-BSIERP study area (Figure 1) during cruises HLY0801 and HLY0802. The benthic camera system was a stand-alone system consisting of a surface-held video camera connected by electronic cable to a camera lens, lights, and laser pointers, all enclosed in a small metal cage, that allows independent deployment and fine control for real-time benthic imaging measurements.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: We are analyzing the digital video imagery to determine epifaunal abundance and composition and compare these to epifaunal-size associated biomass data from previous trawling efforts to convert abundance and size from our camera survey to a rough estimate of biomass over a specific surface area.
