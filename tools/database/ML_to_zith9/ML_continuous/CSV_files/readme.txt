checked_datasets.csv will contain a list of datasets that have already been integrated from ML to zith9. 
The continuous_integrate.py script will continue to update this list as it continues to handle newly created ML datasets.
As of now, this list is a test list. At the end of the initial ML integration, this list should be newly created with a list of datasets in dmg_merged_ml at that time.

ongoing_projects.csv will contain a list of projects that will continue to have datasets added or edited to in the Master List.
This will also be an input for the continuous_integrate.py script to make sure it continues to check the datasets in these projects.
