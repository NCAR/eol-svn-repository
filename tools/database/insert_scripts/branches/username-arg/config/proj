description="The "Collaborative Research: HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study"
will measure cross sections of atmospheric concentrations approximately pole-to-pole, from the surface to the tropopause, four
times during different seasons over a 2 year period. A comprehensive suite of atmospheric trace gases pertinent to understanding
the Carbon Cycle will be measured. HIPPO will transect the mid-Pacific ocean and return either over the Eastern Pacific, or over
the Western Atlantic. The program will provide the first comprehensive, global survey of atmospheric trace gases, covering the
full troposphere in all seasons and multiple years."
