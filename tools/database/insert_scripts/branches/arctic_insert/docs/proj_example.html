description="The "Collaborative Research: HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study"<br />
will measure cross sections of atmospheric concentrations approximately pole-to-pole, from the surface to the tropopause, four<br />
times during different seasons over a 2 year period. A comprehensive suite of atmospheric trace gases pertinent to understanding<br />
the Carbon Cycle will be measured. HIPPO will transect the mid-Pacific ocean and return either over the Eastern Pacific, or over<br />
the Western Atlantic. The program will provide the first comprehensive, global survey of atmospheric trace gases, covering the<br />
full troposphere in all seasons and multiple years."<br />
