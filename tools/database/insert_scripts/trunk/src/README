### PRODUCTION USAGE ###

To run this code in production mode, add the following to your '~/.my_defaults'
file: 

    setenv DMG_MYCNF_PATH ~eoldata/.my.cnf

This will set the default database to emdac and all loaded datasets will appear
on https://data.eol.ucar.edu or https://dmg.eol.ucar.edu/dts/dln.

To run the deployed code, run load_data_proj to create your yaml file, then
load_a_dataset to load the data to codiac and the dts. See docs/ dir for
more detailed documentation.


### DEVELOPMENT ###

Check out this tree from svn
> svn co http://svn.eol.ucar.edu/svn/dmg/tools/database/insert_scripts/trunk/

To do development on this code, run the scripts with the '-dev' command line
option.

When you run with -dev, loaded datasets will appear on
https://data.dev.eol.ucar.edu. There is no dts website, so login to the
database directly to see what you loaded.

To deploy your changes for testing:

    deploy dev

To deploy your changes for production:

    deploy install

### SVN INFO ###

If you are not familiar with SVN (subversion), it is an open source revision control system that predates Git. The following commands behave alot light git commands:

svn status
svn add
svn update
svn commit -m "Commit comment"

with the following exception. All changes to files are committed with the next commit. You do not need to svn add files before commit unless they are new/untracked files.
