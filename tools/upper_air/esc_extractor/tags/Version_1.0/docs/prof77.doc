If it's any use to you, a book on Fortran77 is available over the net.
It covers the complete language, but the earlier chapters are suitable
for relative beginners, such as those who only know something like BASIC.

A few years ago I wrote "Professional Programmers' Guide to Fortran77"
which was published by Pitman.  It is now out of print, which means that
I can do what I like with the text.  Since Fortran77 is now more-or-less
obsolete, I decided to convert it to Latex and make it available to
anyone who wanted to read it.  You are welcome to copy and read it, but
not to sell it for profit.  It is available by anonymous ftp as Latex
source-code and as a Postscript file (and compressed by gzip). Note that
the complete text consists of 122 pages.
