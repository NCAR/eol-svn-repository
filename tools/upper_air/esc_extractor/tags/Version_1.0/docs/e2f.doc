E2F - error to flag

A simple program to change the standard error QC values in the
source data of some SCF files to the QC flags (Good/Bad/...)
expected by S2M. Considers cmd line args to be filenames,
or converts stdin to stdout if no args.
 Output file is called "file.jcls"
This program was intended only to help compare data with Claude
Morel (NCAR/ATD), who uses the std err values for his interpolation
program. To run e2f and s2m on /fest/snd/cape/intercomp/* :
 cat /fest/snd/cape/intercomp/xmddhhmm.sss | e2f | s2m > sssmddhh.10mb
