This software was run for the OTREC and HIGHWAY projects.  Changes were being made
for the SWEX project, before the project was postponed in 2020.  Changes were
then being made for the ACCLIP project, before we found out that someone else
was creating the skew-t plots for the field catalog.  So neither the SWEX nor
the ACCLIP versions were ever run in production mode.

Update June 2025:
The software checked in is based on the SWEX project which was run in 2022.  
The software was ported to eol-hurricane in 2025 and the software was set up to
run in its own environemnt.  These latest changes have been checked into svn, but
these changes have never been run in a production environment.  It is believed
this version of the software will run in a production environment.
