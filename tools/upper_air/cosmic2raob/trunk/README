FIRST: CONFIRM PARAMS IN NETCDF ARE WHAT WE NEED IN TXT FILE. EMAIL JULIE WITH 
PARAM-PARAM COMPARISON LIST AND MAKE SURE I DID IT RIGHT. IF PARAMS MUST BE 
CALCULATED, EMAIL SFW!!!
Else spend about a day on this at most. Charge RAF as 
would charge other HAIS work (normal RAF acct, I think.)

- sample wetPrf NetCDF data file directly from COSMIC containing a sounding 
profile. 
- text file containing a rawinsonde profile probably from the NOAA ESRL 
archive. This text format is the one Julie prefers to work from when processing 
her MPR data. 

Estimate time to write converter.

From Doug Hunt:

Hi Steve:  My first recommendation would be to not convert the wetPrf 
netCDF files to ASCII first, but just to read in the netCDF data.  netCDF 
interfaces exist for many dozens of different environments and once you 
have access to one of these interfaces, the files are easier to read than 
ASCII.

For example, if you're working in FORTRAN, install the netCDF libraries 
and then you can read in whole profiles in one line from FORTRAN.  Same 
thing if you are working from perl, C, python, IDL, MATLAB, etc.

I could quickly write an ASCII translator, but it would require perl, 
netcdf and several other perl libraries to work on a remote system.

Given more time I could write an ASCII translator that only requires C and 
the netCDF library, but in all cases, netCDF libraries would have to be 
installed.  If you are going to that effort, why not just read the netCDF 
files directly?

Regards,

  Doug Hunt

Steve and Janine,

The software which would need to read the netCDF files is in VisualBasic, We 
briefly explored means for ingesting netCDF files directly, but it's not 
straightforward in theVB environment and is complicated by the fact that no one 
here knows much VB (the software was written by one of the HAIS instrument 
developers, and we have limited access to his time for modifications such as 
this). So that avenue is not a simple one either.
