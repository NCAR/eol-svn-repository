<p>Data for the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) 2004 Tier 3 domain (5&deg;N 
  to 50&deg;N latitude and 75&deg;W to 125&deg;W longitude) data are contained in this
  dataset. The dataset covers the time period of 01 June 2004 through 30 September 2004. This NAME 
  2004 Sounding Composite 5-mb Upper-Air Dataset contains 21254 soundings 
  from 91 sites.</p>

<p>Most of the soundings have passed through the NCAR/EOL automatic quality control. The 
  tethersondes from the Mexican UNAM R/V El Puma did not run through the quality control performed by 
  the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR/EOL).</p>

<p><a href="#section2.0">Section 2.0</a> contains a detailed description of the source network that collected the data.  <a href="#section2.1">Section 2.1</a> contains a detailed description of the format of the composite dataset.  See <a href="#section3.0">Section 3.0</a> below for the quality control processing performed by NCAR/EOL on this dataset.  <a href="#section4.0">Section 4.0</a> contains references.</p>



<a name="section2.0"></a><h2>2.0 Detailed Data Description</h2>

<p>The `native' resolution data for every sounding were interpolated to 5 hPa 
  vertical resolution files. The surface data point was kept as the initial level 
  in each sounding. The first interpolated data point was at the next lowest pressure 
  evenly divisible by 5 and then every 5 hPa pressure level beyond that point 
  to either 50 hPa or the lowest pressure level reached by the radiosonde, whichever 
  came first. The first 15 lines of each file (the header information) were kept 
  without change.</p>
<p>For the interpolation, the software searched for two data points around the 
  desired pressure level. The search was conducted by looking for two valid (i.e. 
  non-missing) data points around the desired pressure level, while also paying 
  attention to the time difference between the two data points as well as their 
  quality control flags. There was a search for the two best possible data points 
  to use in the interpolation. If the desired pressure level was within the original 
  dataset, that data point was used without interpolation.</p>
<p>There was first a search for values flagged as good within some time range 
  (50 sec for temperature, humidity, and wind and 100 sec for pressure; hereafter 
  termed the ARANGE) and the interpolated data point was flagged as good. Failing 
  that, it searched for values flagged as estimated within the same time range 
  and the interpolated data point was flagged as estimated. Then the search went 
  for good values within a wider time range (100 sec for temperature, humidity, 
  and wind and 200 sec for pressure; hereafter termed the BRANGE) the flag for 
  the interpolated data point here was then degraded (even though two `good' data 
  points were used there was a significant time difference between them) to questionable. 
  Then, in turn, estimated values within the BRANGE were used (flag set to questionable), 
  questionable values within the BRANGE (flag set to bad), good values greater 
  than the BRANGE apart (flag set to bad), estimated values greater than BRANGE 
  apart (flag set to bad), questionable values greater than BRANGE apart (flag 
  set to bad), finally any bad values (flag set to bad). This search was conducted 
  separately for each interpolated variable (pressure, temperature, relative humidity, 
  and the u and v wind components.</p>
<p>Thus for each interpolated data point, the quality control flag was set to 
  the worst case among the data points used in the interpolation, except, for 
  each time range apart, the quality control flag was degraded one level (i.e. 
  good to questionable, etc).</p>
<p> The quality control flags should be carefully heeded in these files. While 
  some of the data may look good, it may have been interpolated over large pressure 
  intervals, and thus be suspect.<br>
  <br>
  For each interpolated data point the dew point was calculated from the temperature 
  and relative humidity (<a href="#section4.0">Bolton 1980</a>) and the total 
  wind speed and direction were calculated from the interpolated u and v component 
  values. Also, the altitude and time were interpolated using the same data points 
  used for the pressure interpolation. The ascension rate was recalculated based 
  on the time and altitude values from the two data points used to interpolate 
  the 5 hPa data point. Thus the ascension rate values do not reflect the values 
  based on the interpolated data. The latitude and longitude values were interpolated 
  using the same data points used in the wind component interpolation.</p>


<a name="belize"></a><h3>2.0.1 Belize City, Belize</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 140 high vertical resolution (2 second) soundings from the Belize City site in Belize (WMO 78583).  Soundings were typically released once per day (1200 UTC) from 01 June to 13 July 2004 and twice per day from 14 July to 02 September 2004.  The sites antenna failed on 03 September 2004 so no soundings are available for the remainder of the NAME time period.</p>

<a name="ulloa"></a><h3>2.0.2 Mexican CICESE R/V Francisco de Ulloa</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 90 high vertical resolution (2 second) soundings from the Centro de Investigaci&oacute;n Cien&iacute;fica y de Educatci&oacute; Superior de Ensendada (CICESE) Research Vessel (R/V) Francisco de Ulloa.  During NAME the R/V Francisco de Ulloa conducted two cruises (05 June through 21 June 2004 and 06 August through 16 August 2004) through the Gulf of California.  Soundings were typically released four times per day.</p>
<p>
The R/V Ulloa utilized two different types of radiosondes during NAME.
<p>
1. RS-80G - fresh radiosondes that measured temperature, pressure, humidity and winds.
They expected small biases in pressure and humidity (3%) with these radiosondes.  These
soundings were most often released at the 0000 and 1200 UTC release times.
<p>
2. RS-80N - older radiosondes that measured temperature, pressure and humidity
(these soundings do not include wind measurements).  They expected larger biases
with these radiosondes.  These soundings were most often released at the 0600 and
1800 UTC release times.

<p>More information about the R/V Francisco de Ulloa can be found at <a href="http://oceanografia.cicese.mx/fcoulloa/">http://oceanografia.cicese.mx/fcoulloa/</a> (<a href="#section4.0">CICESE, 2005</a>).</p>

<a name="altair"></a><h3>2.0.3 Mexican Navy SEMAR R/V Altair</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 153 high vertical resolution (2 second) soundings from the Secretaria de Marina Armada Mexico (SEMAR) Research Vessel (R/V) Altair.  During NAME the R/V Altair was located near 23.5&deg;N and 108.0&deg;W for two cruises (07 July through 22 July 2004 and 27 July through 12 August 2004).  Soundings were typically released four times per day but they were more frequent during Intensive Observing Periods (IOPs).  These data were provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Environmental Technology Laboratory (NOAA/ETL).</p>

<a name="elpuma"></a><h3>2.0.4 Mexican UNAM R/V El Puma</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 31 high vertical resolution (approximately 10 second) tethersondes from the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) Research Vessel (R/V) El Puma.  During NAME the R/V El Puma was conducted during the ECAC-5 cruise (06 August through 17 August 2004).  NCAR/EOL did do any quality control on these data.</p>
<p>The release location was determined from a separate navigational parameters 
  file containing one minute data. The nearest minute in the navigational parameters 
  file was used from the release time of the sounding.</p>
<p>An additional document <a href="http://www.joss.ucar.edu/data/name/docs/Reporte-ECAC-5.doc">Reporte-ECAC-5.doc</a> (<a href="#section4.0">UNAM, 2005</a>) was provided from the ECAC project that describes the methodology used by the UNAM in developing the data set. This document is in Spanish.</p>

<a name="smn"></a><h3>2.0.5 Mexico SMN-CNA</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 2468 high vertical resolution (2 second) soundings from 15 stations from the Servicio Meteorol&oacute;gico Nacional (SMN) Comisi&oacute;n del Agua (CNA), which forms part of the Secretar&iacute;a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT).  Soundings were typically released twice per day, but were released up to 8 per day by selected stations during intensive operations.</p>

  (<a href="#section4.0">SMN, 2005</a>). It is in Spanish</p>

<a name="glass"></a><h3>2.0.6 NCAR GLASS (Loreto)</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 175 high vertical resolution (1 second) soundings from 
  the GPS Loran Atmospheric Sounding System (GLASS) site in Loreto, Mexico between 
  09 July and 15 August 2004. These data were provided by the National Center 
  of Atmospheric Research/Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR/EOL).</p>

<h4>NCAR/EOL Data File Specifics</h4>
<p>The variables pressure, temperature, and relative humidity are calibrated values 
  from measurements made by the radiosonde. The dew point is calculated from the 
  relative humidity. The altitude is calculated from the hydrostatic equation 
  using pressure, temperature, and dew point. The rate of ascent is obtained from 
  the altitude difference between two successive time steps. The position (latitude, 
  longitude) are computed by using horizontal winds to integrate location from 
  the initial launch position.</p>
<p>All wind data are computed from GPs navigation signals received from the radiosonde. 
  The raw wind values are calculated at a one-half second data rate by a commercial 
  processing card. These raw values are subjected to a digital filter to remove 
  low frequency oscillations due to the sonde pendulum motion beneath the balloon. 
  The resolution of the data is reduced to one second. This time record is used 
  in the interpolation of the pressure, temperature, and humidity data.</p>
<h4>NCAR/EOL Data Quality Control</h4>
<p>The raw soundings are first run through the Atmospheric Sounding Processing ENvironment (ASPEN), which analyzes the data, performs smoothing, and removes suspect data points.  The soundings are then visually evaluated for outliers, or any other obvious problems.  Scatter plots of the data are created to check the range in values of pressure, temperature and relative humidity.  Lastly, we create profiles of temperature and RH, and wind speed and direction, in order to check for any major inconsistencies.</p>
<h4>NCAR/EOL Important Note to Users</h4>
<p>The first data line in each sounding, denoted by a time stamp of -1.0 second, typically represents data collected from an independent surface met station.  During the quality control process this data is used as a reference to determine the accuracy of the radiosondes pressure, temperature and relative humidity measurements.  The surface met sensors at the Loreto GLASS site failed to work during the project, so in place of the surface met data, pre-launch pressure, temperature and RH measured by the sonde and human estimated winds were entered into the first line of each sounding.  A major concern is that if sensor arm heating (which is a common problem during projects where sondes are launched in warm weather without proper ventilation, as was the case at Loreto) occurred, there is either no way to detect it or the extent of it.   From looking at the scatter plots, shown in figure 2 below, and visually comparing the GLASS data with that collected at the ISS sites, there seems to be no evidence of sensor arm heating.  However, we wanted to make the users were aware of what had been done and to warn them to be skeptical about the accuracy of the GLASS radiosonde data near the surface.</p>

<a name="iss"></a><h3>2.0.7 NCAR Integrated Sounding System (ISS)</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 460 high vertical resolution (1 second) soundings from 3 Integrated Sounding System (ISS) sites in Mexico; Port Penasco (ISS2), Kino Bay (ISS3), and Los Mochis (ISS4), between 03 July and 15 August 2004.

San Cristobal released soundings semi-daily, however, there are days within the time period where rawinsonde data is missing or a rawinsonde was not released.  All soundings were made with Vaisala RS-80 sondes which utilized GPS tracking to determine the winds.</p>

<a name="yuma"></a><h3>2.0.12 US DOD Yuma Proving Ground (Arizona)</h3>
<p>This 5-mb dataset was derived from 933 high vertical resolution (5 seconds up to 480 seconds after release and 10 seconds from 480 seconds after the release to the end of the sounding) soundings from 3 sites in Yuma, Arizona.  These data were provided by the United States Army Met Team from the Yuma Proving Ground.  The 3555 site is the station that is sent over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) as WMO index 74004.</p>

<a name="section2.1"></a><h2>2.1 Detailed Format Description</h2>
<p>All upper air soundings were converted to National Center for Atmospheric Research/Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR/EOL) Sounding Composite Format (ESCF).  ESCF is a version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CLASS format and is an ASCII format consisting of 15 header records for each sounding followed by the data records with associated QC information.</p>

<h4>Header Records</h4>
<p>The header records (15 total records) contain data type, project ID, site ID, site location, release time, sonde type, meteorological and wind data processors, and the operator's name and comments.  The first five header lines contain information identifying the sounding, and have a rigidly defined form.  The following 7 header lines are used for auxiliary information and comments about the sounding, and may vary from dataset to dataset.  The last 3 header records contain header information for the data columns.  Line 13 holds the field names, line 14 the field units, and line 15 contains dashes ('-' characters) delineating the extent of the field.</p>
<p>The five standard header lines are as follows:</p>

<table border=1 bordercolor="black" align="center">
<tr><th>Line</th><th>Label (padded to 35 char)</th><th>Contents</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Data Type:</td><td>Description of type and resolution of data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Project ID:</td><td>Id of weather project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Release Site Type/Site ID:</td><td>Description of the release site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Release Location (lon,lat,alt):</td><td>Position of release site in the format described below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>UTC Release Time (y,m,d,h,m,s):</td><td>Time of release, in the format: yyyy, mm, dd, hh:mm:ss</td></tr>
</table>
     
<p>The release location is given as:  lon (deg min), lat (deg min), lon (dec. deg), lat (dec. deg), alt (m)</p>
<p>Longitude in deg min is in the format:  ddd mm.mm'W where ddd is the number of degrees from True North (with leading zeros if necessary), mm.mm is the decimal number of minutes, and W represents W or E for west or east longitude, respectively. Latitude has the same format as longitude, except there are only two digits for degrees and N or S for north/south latitude. The decimal equivalent of longitude and latitude and station elevation follow.</p>
<p>The seven nonstandard header lines may contain any label and contents. The 
  labels are padded to 35 characters to match the standard header lines. Records 
  for this dataset include the following three nonstandard header lines.</p>

<table border=1 bordercolor="black" align="center">
<tr><th>Line</th><th>Label (padded to 35 char)</th><th>Contents</th></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nominal Release Time (y,m,d,h,m,s):</td><td>Nominal time of release, in the format: yyyy, mm, dd, hh:mm:ss</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Data Records</h4>
<p>The data records each contain time from release, pressure, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, U and V wind components, wind speed and direction, ascent rate, balloon position data, altitude, and quality control flags (see the QC code description).  Each data line contains 21 fields, separated by spaces, with a total width of 130 characters.  The data are right-justified within the fields.  All fields have one decimal place of precision, with the exception of latitude and longitude, which have three decimal places of precision.  The contents and sizes of the 21 fields that appear in each data record are as follows:</p>

<h2>3.3 Data Quality Issues</h2>

<h3>3.3.1 Belize City, Belize</h3>
<h4>Data Averaging</h4>
<p>Belize is one of the Caribbean upper air sites that has had a known problem 
  with erratic and inconsistent meteorological parameter reports in the high resolution 
  data from the B-2 sondes used in conjunction with the 1500C.</p>
<p>To alleviate this known problem, the data were rederived from the raw data using a seven point traveling average to smooth these fluctuations that appeared in the raw data. The averaging used the previous three points, the current point, and the following three points to make the averaged record for the new current point. The first three points of the record were assumed correct since there were not three previous points to use in the average.</p>
<p>The measurements of pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and the U and 
  V wind components were averaged. The remaining parameters were derived from 
  the new averaged values. In the cases where there were missing values in the 
  average, the average was not calculated and was set to the corresponding missing 
  value instead.</p>

<h3>3.3.2 Mexican CICESE R/V Francisco de Ulloa</h3>
<h4>Humidity Biases</h4>
<p>The older Vaisala RS80-N radiosondes (typically released at the 0600 and 1800 UTC release times) have a substantial dry bias in the measured humidity values evident in the data. The raw data set included over 16000 negative relative humidity values. These have been set to missing in this processed data set. No corrections have been applied to these data.</p>

<h3>3.3.3 Mexican Navy SEMAR R/V Altair</h3>
<h4>Noise Levels</h4>
<p>The amount of noise in the high resolution data was substantially more significant in the first cruise (7-22 July 2004) than in the second cruise (26 July - 18 August 2004).</p>

<h3>3.3.4 NOAA National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS)</h3>
<p>NWS soundings during NAME utilized either the VIZ type radiosonde produced by Sippican Inc. (http://www.sippican.com/meteorological.html) or the Vaisala RS-80 radiosonde (http://www.vaisala.com, under "Product and Systems/Radiosonde,dropsondes,rockectsondes").</p>
<p>The use of the raw 6-sec resolution elevation and azimuth angle data to derive the winds sometimes led to large oscillations in wind speed, due to the presence of oscillations in the elevation angle data, particularly at low elevation angles.  The general approach to correct this problem was to remove the out-lier radiosonde position data before computing the wind components (Williams et al. 1993).  For both the azimuth and elevation angles from 360 sec to the end of the sounding, a ninth order polynomial was fit to the curve.  The residuals were calculated and compared to the observed values.  The outliers of the residuals were then removed.</p>
<p>Then to help correct the more extensive problems at low elevation angles within 10 degrees of the limiting angles (LA) some additional smoothing was applied.  If the elevation angle was between (LA + 7.5) and (LA + 10), the new elevation angle was computed with a 2 min linear fit.  If the elevation angle was between (LA + 5) and (LA + 7.5), the new elevation angle was computed with a 3 min linear fit.  If the elevation
angle was less than (LA + 5), the new elevation angle was computed with a 4 min linear fit.  If the number of observations with low elevation angles was greater than 20% of the total number of observations for the sounding no frequency smoothing occurred.</p>
<p>Then, for the elevation angle only, a finite Fourier analysis was performed on the residuals.  Periods from 90-190 sec were removed and those below 30 sec were flattened.</p>
<p>Finally, a 2 min second order polynomial was then fit to the position to derive 
  the u and v wind components, except for the beginning and end minute (or 1.5 
  minutes if over 50 Mb) which used a 3 min fit. If there were less than 15% of 
  the total number of points, not counting the beginning or end of the flight, 
  on one side of the point for which the wind value was being computed, a linear 
  fit was used.</p>
<p>For further information on this methodology and its changes since <a href="#section4.0">Williams et al. (1993)</a> please see <a href="#section4.0">Williams, et al. (1998)</a>.</p>
<h4>Near Surface Winds</h4>
<p>A common problem in near surface wind speed values calculated from the 6-second 
  position data is that the first radiosonde wind speed is much higher than the 
  independently measured surface value. The calculated radiosonde winds then decrease 
  rapidly so that within about 60 s (20-30 Mb) after release the wind speeds are 
  more realistic. The cause of this appears to be the acceptance of radiosonde 
  position data prior to a "good lock" being achieved on the radiosonde by the 
  tracking system. Thus there appear to be rapid positional shifts of the radiosonde 
  while the tracking system "searches" for the radiosonde.</p>
<h4>Wind Oscillations</h4>
<p>Despite the extensive efforts to remove oscillations in wind speeds caused by oscillations in elevation angles (see Section 2.2) there are occasional cases with remaining oscillations.  Most of the remaining oscillations have periods just slightly longer than the 190 s maximum point of our notch filter.</p>

<h3>3.3.5 San Jose, Costa Rica UCR-IMN</h3>
<h4>Date and Time Mismatches in Raw Data Files</h4>
<p>There were a number of cases where there was conflicting date and time information in the provided data files. Contacts at San Jose were able to verify some of the information, but not all.</p>
<p>The soundings that are labeled at the following times <b>were unable</b> to be verified by San Jose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>17 June at 0000 UTC (there are two conflicting pieces of information in the data file. One has a start time of 16 June at 228 UTC and the other specifies a start time of 17 June at 2338 UTC).</li>
  <li>4 August at 1200 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file is 3 August at 1200 UTC but there is already another sounding in the data set at that time).</li>
</ul>
<p>The soundings that are labeled at the following times <b>were</b> verified by San Jose:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 July at 0600 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file was 30 June at 0600.</li>
  <li>25 July at 0600 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file was 24 July at 0600.</li>
  <li>30 July at 0600 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file was 29 July at 0600.</li>
  <li>1 August at 0600 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file was 1 July at 0600.</li>
  <li>27 August at 0600 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file was 26 August at 0600.</li>
  <li>29 August at 0600 UTC (the conflicting time in the data file was 28 August at 0600.</li>
</ul>
