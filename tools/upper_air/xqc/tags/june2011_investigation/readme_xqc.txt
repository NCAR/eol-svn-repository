The original XQC (sounding quality control) software tool
was written by Mark Bradford in the late 1900's. As of 
June 2011 it was still in use and a copy of his original
software as supplied by him is located in the xqc directory.
See the tags area for a duplicate copy of the original tool.
In June 2011, summer intern, Monica Jacobs, began working 
on the task described in XQC_taskDescription.doc document. 
She completed doing an investigation on what might be a 
better method &/or how to redevelop the XQC tool into a 
more modern tool.  Her recommendations and findings can 
be found in the XQC_report.pdf doc.  She also began working 
on a mockup (Java) form of the tool and that 
is located in the gui.java file.  June 2011 - LEC
