    <p>This document contains the API documentation for the Upper Air Day File Creators.</p>

    <p>The day file creators merge sounding files into sorted day files.  The soundings are organized by nominal release date and time followed by the location of release (latitude then longitude).</p>

    <p>The creator can be run on any set of properly formatted soundings.  They can be a sounding per file, a random collection of soundings in a single file, or multiple sets of day files to be merged into a single set of day files.</p>
