The XQC development project started with the IDV 4.1 source code.  See this web page for
information on system requirements for IDV: 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/Systems.html.
See this web page for information on downloading and installing the IDV:
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/docs/userguide/Starting.html
and this web page for building IDV from source:

I installed NetBeans 7.2, Java 1.6, and Java 3D 1.5 (java3d.java.net) on my Mac.  At this time, 
there were no standard Java 3D libraries, so the systems group would not install Java 3D on the
server, so development had to be done on my local computer.  The following jar libraries
were used for compiling the software:
ncIdv.jar
visad.jar
external.jar
jython.jar
auxdata.jar
and the DMG jar libraries:
upper_air.jar
utilities.jar
  
I added classes under ucar/unidata/data/sounding for reading in ESC formatted
soundings.  I was able to read in an ESC sounding, but I was not able to display it.
At this time, all development work was halted on xqc because of lack of funds to continue
the work.  The software uses the DMG jar libraries that read the ESC sounding format.

The software is in two tar files, one is the src code, src.tar, and the other is the 
distribution files, dist.tar.  The src.tar includes the IDV source code with the changes
that I made to read in ESC soundings.  The dist.tar includes all the jar files mentioned
above that are needed to run the IDV software.  I ran the new code from within NetBeans, 
from the main idv application.
