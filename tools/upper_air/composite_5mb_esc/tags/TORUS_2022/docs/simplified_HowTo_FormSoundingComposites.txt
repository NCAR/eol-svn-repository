How To Form the Sounding Compsites - Simplified Instructions

Updated: 9 March 2023 LEC

1. Copy the directory setup from the SVN repository location into the work area. You may want 
to only checkout one of the project tags so review the contents from the SVN trunk versus the
tags. Recommend looking at the latest project tags such as WINTRE-MIX 2022 and SWEX 2019.

From the work area do the following command:

svn checkout http://svn.eol.ucar.edu/svn/dmg/tools/upper_air/composite_highres_esc/trunk .

2. Edit the build.xml file and search for and then replace the project name accordingly plus
the new directory name for this project. See top of the build.xml file.
The project name will affect the final output files names that will be loaded into the archive. 

    vi build.xml

3. Copy input dayfiles or individual *.cls files (or a mix of either) into the /data directory.
A copy of the same data can generally be found in the /input_data directory, too, but it's the
data in the /data directory that will be used to form the final, composite dayfiles.  NOTE: for the 
5mb or 50m files, the suffices of the file you place in the /data directory MUST have their suffices
changed to be *.cls.  The "ant dayfiles" command in the build.xml file only process the *.cls 
files in the /data directory. 

4. Run the "dayfiles" command from the build.xml file. The output from this ant command will
place the final data into the /database directory. Do "which ant" to ensure that you can 
access and run the build.xml command to form the composite. When you run the following command,
dayfiles will be created in the /database directory.  Run the following command:
 
   ant dayfiles

**You can screen grab the output from this command and place that into a dayfiles.log file. 

5. Once the dayfiles have been created in the /database dir, you may want to rerun the 
check_format ant command. That can be found in the build.xml file used for most sounding
data conversions. The individual network processed data have already had both the check-format
and visual QC run so a final check_format may not be necessary.

6. The science staff creates the readme file for the composites. Ask them for that documentation
to load with the composite dayfiles into the archive.
