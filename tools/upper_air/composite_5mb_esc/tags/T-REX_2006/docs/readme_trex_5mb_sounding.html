<p>Data for the Terrain-induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX) 2006 domain (25&deg;N 
to 37&deg;N latitude and 118&deg;W to 114&deg;W are contained within this dataset.
The dataset covers the time period 1 March 2006 through 30 April 2006.  This 
T-REX 2006 Sounding Composite 5-mb Resolution Upper-Air Dataset contains 1299 
soundings from 13 platforms.</p>
<p><a href="#section2.1">Section 2.1</a> contains a detailed description of the 
format of the composite dataset. See <a href="#section3.0">Section 3.0</a> below 
for the quality control processing  performed by NCAR/EOL on this dataset. 
<a href="#section4.0">Section 4.0</a> contains references.</p>

<a name="section2.0"></a><h2>2.0 Detailed Data Description</h2>
<p>
The `native' resolution data for every sounding were interpolated to 5 hPa vertical resolution files. The surface data point was kept
as the initial level in each sounding. The first interpolated data point was at the next lowest pressure evenly divisible by 5 and then
every 5 hPa pressure level beyond that point to either 50 hPa or the lowest pressure level reached by the radiosonde, whichever came
first. The first 15 lines of each file (the header information) were kept without change.
<p>
For the interpolation, the software searched for two data points around the desired pressure level. The search was conducted by looking
for two valid (i.e. non-missing) data points around the desired pressure level, while also paying attention to the time difference
between the two data points as well as their quality control flags. There was a search for the two best possible data points to use in
the interpolation. If the desired pressure level was within the original dataset, that data point was used without interpolation.
<p>
There was first a search for values flagged as good within some time range (50 sec for temperature, humidity, and wind and 100 sec for
pressure; hereafter termed the ARANGE) and the interpolated data point was flagged as good. Failing that, it searched for values
flagged as estimated within the same time range and the interpolated data point was flagged as estimated. Then the search went for good
values within a wider time range (100 sec for temperature, humidity, and wind and 200 sec for pressure; hereafter termed the BRANGE)
the flag for the interpolated data point here was then degraded (even though two `good' data points were used there was a significant
time difference between them) to questionable. Then, in turn, estimated values within the BRANGE were used (flag set to questionable),
questionable values within the BRANGE (flag set to bad), good values greater than the BRANGE apart (flag set to bad), estimated values
greater than BRANGE apart (flag set to bad), questionable values greater than BRANGE apart (flag set to bad), finally any bad values
(flag set to bad). This search was conducted separately for each interpolated variable (pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and
the u and v wind components.
<p>
Thus for each interpolated data point, the quality control flag was set to the worst case among the data points used in the
interpolation, except, for each time range apart, the quality control flag was degraded one level (i.e. good to questionable, etc).
<p>
The quality control flags should be carefully heeded in these files. While some of the data may look good, it may have been
interpolated over large pressure intervals, and thus be suspect.
<p>
For each interpolated data point the dew point was calculated from the temperature and relative humidity (Bolton 1980) and the total
wind speed and direction were calculated from the interpolated u and v component values. Also, the altitude and time were interpolated
using the same data points used for the pressure interpolation. The ascension rate was recalculated based on the time and altitude
values from the two data points used to interpolate the 5 hPa data point. Thus the ascension rate values do not reflect the values
based on the interpolated data. The latitude and longitude values were interpolated using the same data points used in the wind
component interpolation.
<p>
For the AFRL Radiosonde and Thermosonde data, no times are included in the submitted data set.  So a similar
procedure was used as described above.  First, the wind records in the submitted data set did not include
pressure values.  The pressure for the wind records was interpolated using the altitude at the wind record
and the surrounding PTH records that included both altitude and pressure.  Once every record has a pressure
value, the 5 mb records were interpolated for each parameter separately based on the two records with 
pressures on either side of the 5 mb level and non-missing values of the pressure in question.  The quality
control flag was set to the worst case among the data points used in the interpolation.  If values more
than 5 mb apart were used to interpolate a questionable flag was applied (unless the flag was already bad).
<p>
<a name="section2.1"></a><h2>2.1 Detailed Format Description</h2>
<p>All upper air soundings were converted to National Center for Atmospheric Research/Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR/EOL) Sounding Composite Format (ESCF).  ESCF is a version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) CLASS format and is an ASCII format consisting of 15 header records for each sounding followed by the data records with associated QC information.</p>

<h4>Header Records</h4>
<p>The header records (15 total records) contain data type, project ID, site ID, site location, release time, sonde type, meteorological and wind data processors, and the operator's name and comments.  The first five header lines contain information identifying the sounding, and have a rigidly defined form.  The following 7 header lines are used for auxiliary information and comments about the sounding, and may vary from dataset to dataset.  The last 3 header records contain header information for the data columns.  Line 13 holds the field names, line 14 the field units, and line 15 contains dashes ('-' characters) delineating the extent of the field.</p>
<p>The five standard header lines are as follows:</p>

<table border=1 bordercolor="black" align="center">
<tr><th>Line</th><th>Label (padded to 35 char)</th><th>Contents</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Data Type:</td><td>Description of type and resolution of data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Project ID:</td><td>Id of weather project.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Release Site Type/Site ID:</td><td>Description of the release site.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Release Location (lon,lat,alt):</td><td>Position of release site in the format described below.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>UTC Release Time (y,m,d,h,m,s):</td><td>Time of release, in the format: yyyy, mm, dd, hh:mm:ss</td></tr>
</table>
     
<p>The release location is given as:  lon (deg min), lat (deg min), lon (dec. deg), lat (dec. deg), alt (m)</p>
<p>Longitude in deg min is in the format:  ddd mm.mm'W where ddd is the number of degrees from True North (with leading zeros if necessary), mm.mm is the decimal number of minutes, and W represents W or E for west or east longitude, respectively. Latitude has the same format as longitude, except there are only two digits for degrees and N or S for north/south latitude. The decimal equivalent of longitude and latitude and station elevation follow.</p>
<p>The seven nonstandard header lines may contain any label and contents. The 
  labels are padded to 35 characters to match the standard header lines. Records 
  for this dataset include the following three nonstandard header lines.</p>

<table border=1 bordercolor="black" align="center">
<tr><th>Line</th><th>Label (padded to 35 char)</th><th>Contents</th></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Nominal Release Time (y,m,d,h,m,s):</td><td>Nominal time of release, in the format: yyyy, mm, dd, hh:mm:ss</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Data Records</h4>
<p>The data records each contain time from release, pressure, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, U and V wind components, wind speed and direction, ascent rate, balloon position data, altitude, and quality control flags (see the QC code description).  Each data line contains 21 fields, separated by spaces, with a total width of 130 characters.  The data are right-justified within the fields.  All fields have one decimal place of precision, with the exception of latitude and longitude, which have three decimal places of precision.  The contents and sizes of the 21 fields that appear in each data record are as follows:</p>
