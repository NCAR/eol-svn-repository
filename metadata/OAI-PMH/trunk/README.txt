This OAI-PMH implementation was created during the summer of 2013 as a proof-of-concept with
a DCERC intern. This is no longer in use nor is it intended to be of use. It was written in
Perl and served static file-based records.

The new implementation is currently baked into the zinc codebase in the form of an additional
controller and service class. It is written in Groovy and Grails and serves records directly
from the database.

This Perl implementation serves only for historical purposes and of no practical use anymore.
