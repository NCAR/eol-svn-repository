    <dc:description>The data sets in the data table have been collected as part of a project to understand how reduced sea ice cover in the Arctic will impact polar bear populations. Bears that stay ashore in summer have almost no access to food and tend to be inactive. Those that stay on the ice, however, have continued access to prey and make extensive movements. Over a three year period, scientists from the University of Wyoming and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) followed the movements of bears in both habitats and monitored their body temperature, muscle condition, blood chemistry, and metabolism. The physiological data will be added to spatially-explicit individual-based population models to predict population response to reduced ice cover.</dc:description>

    <dc:relation>The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program is a multidisciplinary approach to understanding polar processes for climate and global change. ARCSS is the only element of the U.S. Global Change Research Program specifically concerned with the arctic region. By focusing on understanding Arctic processes in great detail, investigators are better able to characterize global changes through the improvement of global-scale models and other research tools.
        
        The primary ARCSS data are archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR/EOL). In 2008 the ARCSS data archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) were transferred to the NCAR/EOL archive.</dc:relation>
