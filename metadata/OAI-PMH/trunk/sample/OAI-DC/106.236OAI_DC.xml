    <dc:description>This data set is part of a project to investigate winter sublimation processes in order to improve and develop models and methods which will accurately and reliably estimate sublimation rates. The project is a five-year field campaign using eddy correlation towers to measure surface fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum. Eddy correlation observations will provide the total moisture flux from the snow surface, which can be attributed to sublimation in cold conditions. 
        This dataset includes data that were collected from two Meteorological towers that were operated near Barrow, Alaska from March to May 2005 and again from October to June 2006. Additional information is available in the readme file, and also the header of each data file.</dc:description>

    <dc:relation>The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program is a multidisciplinary approach to understanding polar processes for climate and global change. ARCSS is the only element of the U.S. Global Change Research Program specifically concerned with the arctic region. By focusing on understanding Arctic processes in great detail, investigators are better able to characterize global changes through the improvement of global-scale models and other research tools.
        
        The primary ARCSS data are archived at the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Earth Observing Laboratory (NCAR/EOL). In 2008 the ARCSS data archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) were transferred to the NCAR/EOL archive.</dc:relation>
