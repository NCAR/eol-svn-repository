    <dc:source>BAMEX, Bow Echo and Mesoscale Convective Vortex Experiment 2003</dc:source>
    <dc:relation>data.eol.ucar.edu/codiac/projs?bamex</dc:relation>
    <dc:relation>BAMEX is a study using highly mobile platforms to examine the life cycles of mesoscale convective systems.  It represents a combination of two related programs to investigate (a) bow echoes, principally those which produce damaging surface winds and last at least 4 hours and (b) larger convective systems which produce long lived mesoscale convective vortices (MCVs). MCVs can focus new convection and play a key role in multi-day convective events affecting a swath sometimes more than 1000 km in length with heavy to perhaps flooding rains.
        Objectives:The main objectives of BAMEX regarding bow echoes are to understand and improve prediction of the mesoscale and cell-scale processes that produce severe winds.  For MCV producing systems the objectives are to understand MCV formation within MCSs, the role of MCVs in initiating and modulating convection, the feedback of convection onto MCV intensity, and to improve the overall predictability of the vortex-convection coupled system.</dc:relation>
