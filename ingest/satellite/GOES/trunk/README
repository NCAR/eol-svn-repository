/home/joss/goes/initial_stage modified to put the data in e.g.
/EOL/operational/satellite/goes//g13/1km/2010/day306.
(note that Greg did not update the change log at the top of the script,
and he left an extra '/' after EOL which causes the double in the path. )

/home/joss/goes/goes_mysql_update.pl was not updated, so the following
datasets are no longer being updated:

http://data.eol.ucar.edu/codiac/dss/id=100.003
http://data.eol.ucar.edu/codiac/dss/id=100.004

causing errors like:

Subject: Cron /home/joss/goes/goes_mysql_update.pl

directory

1) goes_mysqql_update.pl has been superceded by the sat_query tool
and should be turned off.
  - done by Greg 11/3, but sat_query tool is broken, so no access right now.
  - Greg made a note in the crontab documenting why turned off.
2) Hide 100.003 and 100.004 - done by Greg 11/3/2010
3) Figure out if the other two datasets controlled by goes_mysql_update.pl are
still active or not, determine if we broke them, and decide what to do.
4) Update path's in codiac? -This will probably NOT be done (codiac paths
point to /JOSS.) as we will likely eventually delete these datasets.
5)EVERY project that refers to these datasets needs to have the master list
link replaced with a link to the sat_query tool
        - Greg will hide all until sat_query tool is fixed by Susan.

Eventually sat_query database will be rolled into EMDAC database. Then
100.003 and 004 should probably be deleted from codiac to avoid confusion.


For all ingest scripts, Joel's replacement was going to standardize these
scripts, create libraries (there is lots of code duplication), put them
into subversion, and document them. This has not happened.

From crontab:
# sat_query handles goes updates so goes_mysql_update no longer needed.
