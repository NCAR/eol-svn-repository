>>         This is the dilema of processing/archive data from cooperators networks!

>>         I'm surprised that the list isn't much larger.  We've had hundreds of

>>         incremental...and others, especially in West Virgina and Western
>>         portions of Pennsylvania change a couple of times and they've now
>>         settled on accumulators.
>>
>>         Anyone using this data must be aware of the dynamic changes in the
>>         network of sites that are processed by HADS...and be aware of the
>>         potential lag time from when a change is implemted to when we become
>>         aware of the change.  This is far, far from a stable environment.
