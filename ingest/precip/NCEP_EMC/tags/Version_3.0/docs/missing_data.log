In my note for the Aug 2006 data download, I mentioned that NCEP is suspending the 
archiving of those data files until the next phase of CEOP in early 2007.  So, 
whenever there is a glitch in the daily scheduled run that creates the ceopgfs... 
files, they can go missing if I don't act quickly.  Those date in Oct appear to be 
the dates when the operational system was moved to the backup system for a couple 
of days. - Sid

7/11/06 - Added a dummy file (all values set to missing) ceopgfs.2006040412
to ceopavn.200604.tar.  The file is missing because of operational errors
and is unrecoverable. Have added this file in order to have an
uninterrupted stream of files.

stage4.200603.old contains the orig data.
stage4.200603.new contains the reprocessed data.
The reprocessed data has been archived and sent to Chi-Fan.

Hi Janine,

Ying noticed that the small file occurred during a time when there were
other possible problems.  She reran the stage II/IV jobs for the 15-23
March.  I have recreated the stage4.mar2006 file.  There are revised files
for the 15-23 March days, so you should update the Codiac archive with
these files.

Thanks for identifying this instance.
